Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation
Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done
some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original
announcement.) 

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is
the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training
of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe
design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.
Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,
Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.

I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at
MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an
F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening
experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year
or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to
see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines
for future space craft use.

If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would
be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty
have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the
receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they
are rapidly changing!

15,"Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:

1) ""I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and
between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush
your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.""
    -Genesis 3.15

2) ""He who commits sin is of the devil ...""
    -1 John 3.8

3) ""Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...""
    -Luke 1.28

   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.
   First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the
first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of
Satan. ""[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in
the truth because there is no truth in him."" John 8.44.  Now the
proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and ""the
woman"", and enmity between Satan and ""her seed.""  Now the woman is both
Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. 
""Her seed"" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the
same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as
we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that
Mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity
with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her
sinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as
would God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the
serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.
    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the
Archangle Gabriel ""full of grace.""  As I pointed out above this is from
the Greek word ""Kecharitomene"" which means not just full of grace, but a
plenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by
the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, ""Hail you who have been and reamin
filled with grace.""  But that is a little to long to say, so it is
reduced to full of grace.  And as it says, ""you who have been"" Mary had
always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which
was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.
    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done
what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if
God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his
Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the
Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo
, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of
Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on
the matter in ""Ineffibilus Deus."""

15,"
I apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and I
would like to respond to both.

As for the ""goal we can never achieve"", the reward comes from the
trying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for
the prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the
commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.
As it says in 1 John 5:3:  ""This is love for God:  to obey his comands.""
That obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this
requires work on our part.

As for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What
matters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in
what one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to
oneself about believing in the first place.  

Stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by
obligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how
many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when
doing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we
should do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel
Jesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to
Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  ""Preach the Word; be prepared in season and
out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and
careful instruction.""  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1
Timothy 4:16:  ""Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in
them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.""
So, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are
correct first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be
hypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be
a disciple completely in both thought and deed.  "

Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to

However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass

accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I
urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect
threats.

PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with
the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that
justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967
are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called
pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can
never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace.
It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the
law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not
normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than
Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to
marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have
drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to
compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy
endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day
will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,
in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic
affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any
more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their
traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western
democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that
most
American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed
Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.

I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views
and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile

   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only
   Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have
   doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that
   these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the
   right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be
   several, including what would classically be called monophysite or
   Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs
   that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't
   use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply
   because it is not Biblical.  --clh]

Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?

(28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, ""All authority in heaven and on
earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I
have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end
of the age."" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]

The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts
contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the
Trinity the most likely explanation after all?

But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there
forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged
dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian
language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things
like ""one essense and three persons"".  Obviously the three-fold
baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the
term ""three-fold"" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly
consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose
full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely
that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.
Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do
not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae
occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in
the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as
well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.
to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.

""Jesus only"" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this
consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to
ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not
appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of
dealing with the idiomatic phrase ""in the name of"".)

Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard
answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.
I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that ""in the name
of"" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name
of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'
authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism
with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a
certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we
could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific
three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes
baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one
baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to
be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great
damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that
I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of
the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize
mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in
the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that
those groups that actually use ""in the name of Jesus"" now do seem to
have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm
not the one to explain what their doctrine is."

Nobuya ""Higgy"" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):

It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's
actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a
contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of

 + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.
 + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?
 + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!
 + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and
can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as

 + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!

There are those who say that the definition of ""good"" is ""whatever
God happens to want."" But if that is so, then the statement that God
is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.
That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He
is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is
powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he
tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you
defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes
sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you
don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to
Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.

Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any
further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)
meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements
are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements
in particular cases about the course of action most likely to
achieve a good result.

When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in
history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I
might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.
Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural
world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might
""Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of
the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort
of difficulties that they find in Nature."")

Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an
argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.
On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose
that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every
time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: ""Good move!
Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if
I were playing."" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a
chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at
least some of his moves will have me thinking, ""Now, what do suppose
induced him to do that?"" or even, ""Boy, that was a real slip -- he's
just thrown the game away!"" Similarly, if God understands the
workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that
sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.

One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the
controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess
game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was
carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.
However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a
time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did
not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had
thought.

With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total
result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging
that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier
than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.

     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****

In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,
who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell
him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and
when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his
family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: ""Do
not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.""


        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events
   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued
   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,
   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews
   and of Judaism.
        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup
   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of
   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out
   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if
   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have
   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into
   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few
   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a
   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into
   the Promised Land.
        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered
   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,
   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of
   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would
   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.
   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of
   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the
   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility
   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human
   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never
   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.
   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the
   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.
        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming
   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only
   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem
   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,
   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place
   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the
   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in
   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,
   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the
   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish
   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge
   of all humans everywhere.
        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by
   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather
   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined
   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and
   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might
   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.
   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah
   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage
   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss
   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of
   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)
   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it
   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would
   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism
   saved them.

        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]

        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became
   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR
   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,
   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on
   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the
   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast
   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she
   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she
   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.
   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney
   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for
   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking
   at Walt Disney, she said, ""And now, my special thanks to the
   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!"" It was the most
   memorable line of the evening.
        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in
   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive
   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing
   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus
   Epiphanes....

After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him
privately and said, ""You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't
you?"" He answered, ""If that is an example that came to your mind,
then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not
talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it."" I assume
that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no
state of Israel.

Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion
that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His
purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go
on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He
stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and
that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's
heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.
And this raises questions about how an action can be considered
wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has
brought about.

I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has
a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,
instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot
that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers
the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the
knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color
of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that
observers will say: ""How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a
piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its
presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a
great work of art."" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was
looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not
contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,
but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God
would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,
but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not
betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected
Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if
Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set
Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no
Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no
Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If
Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled
the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know
how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its
interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and
just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth
game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops
and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up
the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is
none the less valid).

Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of
Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice
was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's
plans by behaving justly and courageously.

What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, ""I
will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go""?
Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet
with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty
were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather
that what God was telling Moses was something like this: ""If you see
that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be
discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My
purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and
let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his
resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future
historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been
thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.""

To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible
that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are
instruments of God's will?
     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what
Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.
They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that
does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and
punishment.
     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not
the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had
refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the
good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right."

 I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad.
The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator
does not seem like much of a basis for belief.

 And the logic is also appalling: ""God must exist because I want Him to.""

 I have heard this line of ""reasoning"" before and wonder how prevalent
it is. Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is
hopeless (or so the pollsters and newscasts state), but I don't see
where this is a good reason to become religious. If you want 'meaning'
why not just join a cult, such as in Waco? The leaders will give you
the security blanket you desire."

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,
a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state, according to the inputs.

A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are
three inputs required.

A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all
outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output
will be low).

An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since
you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.

A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use
the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the
four enable lines.

Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders.

Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

17,"04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir

By NEJLA SAMMAKIA
 Associated Press Writer
   
GUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have
begun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner 
of the Caucasus.

The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh,
Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former
Soviet Union to fight for independence.

Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the
conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared
war with Armenia.

They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which
were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national
borders that had been only lines on a map.

A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and
demand a separate ""Lezghistan"" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.

Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six
demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures
and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of
Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.

Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon
after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.

At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to
discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a
war they say is not theirs.

""I have been drafted, but I won't go,"" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth
glinting in the sun. ""Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have
nothing to do with Armenia.""

More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.

Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals
drafted in 1992 had served.

""The police don't force people to go,"" he said. ""They are afraid of an
uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.""

All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but
disagreed on how the protest came about.

Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was
about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.

Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the
Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.

""We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about
draft orders,"" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.

""We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, 
the Russians.""

In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,
in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep
over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.

By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they
came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the 
600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.

About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.

""We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,"" complained Mais
Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,
included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.

""We want our own country,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about easily.
But Baku won't listen to us.""

Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other
Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same 
jobs and intermarrying to some degree.

But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and
Persian with strong guttural vowels.

Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest
ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary 
school classes in their language.

Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from
Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the 
Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern
Azerbaijan.

No, that's a word game. The term god is used in a different way usually.
When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is
commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and
that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.
 
Interestingly, there are those who say that ""existence exists"" is one of
the indubitable statements possible.
 
Further, saying god is existence is either a waste of time, existence is
already used and there is no need to replace it by god, or you are implying
more with it, in which case your definition and your argument so far
are incomplete, making it a fallacy.

One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal
emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if
it does it may be in no condition to be ""pop[ped] to the top"" (eg, it
may be iconified).  And even if you can, it may not do what you want -
consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant
window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real
desktop.

Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables
giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the
environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window
on a different server, for example.

15,"Hi...

I'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already,
but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the
environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into
pantheism?

I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate
concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it
being perverted into something dangerous.

As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all
things!), April 2 (Editorial page):
""We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental)
dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that much
of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been
called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism
that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a
reverence formerly accorded real religions.""  (EMPHASIS MINE)."

I'm really not entirely sure I trust EFF any more to be honest.

13,"One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the
relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty
acids (FAs).

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got
out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several
studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing
inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are
discussed in ""Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]

But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be
picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In
the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the
studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the
_other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed
layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are
consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of ""bad"" prostanoid
products to ""good"" prostanoid products could still be fairly ""bad.""
Isn't this ratio the issue?

What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA
supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs
appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the
low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories)."

	Not to pick on Mr. May in particular, of course, but isn't this

	Surely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is
to take this at face value. Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up
something that's pretty secure, with a key that can be escrowed neatly,
and they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons
they state. Yes, those evil guys in the FBI can probably, with some
effort, abuse the system. I got news for you, if the evil guys in
the FBI decide they want to persecute you, they're gonna, and you're
gonna hate it. Fact is, the FBI doesn't want to listen to your phone
calls, and if they do, and if you're using triple-DES, they'll just
get a parabolic microphone and point it at your head.

	This is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly
what they're saying they're doing. As is typical with governments,
it's mismanaged, and full of holes and compromises. As is typical
with our government, it's not too bad, could be worse.

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something
they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be
verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the
chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the
output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output
bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.

If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that
some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that
they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,
DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output
change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think
NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.

Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased
subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee
can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified
later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some
secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without
it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.
(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee
members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which
you have to XOR together to recover the program...

Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the
people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game
and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not
going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility
is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied
about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence
of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will
believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.
If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,
no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.

That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things
anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem
with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took
for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely
possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just
such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to
a Senator...).


I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.
However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same
escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,
they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.

I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen
something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical
information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other.

	   In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my
   knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic
   object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns
   or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type
   of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might
   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
   the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.

There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals)
published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't be
more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe
what is needed and how to set up the apparatus.  

These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can
be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the
moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the
""energy signature"" of organic objects.

I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school.
I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by
first dunking them in water.

same >or part of them are the same?  How about Torah? Are the first five

Yes, yes, and yes.  Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and
as shown by archaeology are the same.  Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.

The Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the
Prophets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings)
and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra,
Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).

And the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is
quite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past
200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead
Sea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the
Old Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas
before, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.

Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus
was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only
the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as
Isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called ""the mighty God.""  And if he
was God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not
possible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead,
your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which is
why he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament."

Hey, it's better than the status quo.

I am far less worried about ""the feds"" tapping my phone than high school 
scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
cordless phone calls.

It would be stupid to rely on even a ""Clipperized"" channel for truly 
sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to 
guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong ""right 
to bear arms"" view of the private right to possess and use strong 
cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would 
actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular 
phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market 
voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.

If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS 
for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.

And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at 
least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...

5,"Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several
Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on
several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, 
2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,
4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely
operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual 
manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found 
it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for
many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle
TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do
a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily
modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems
by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.

Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and
SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.
It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will
need Motif 1.1 or better.

The following files are available for anonymous ftp from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking

tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code
tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries
tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries

What tcpview adds to tcpdump:
- easier interface
- enhanced protocol decoding
- hex display of frame
- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt
- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name
- ethernet address host table
- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames
- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional
	processing.

CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1

New features:

Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the 
file type will be automatically detected.

Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.

The hex format has been changed.

New time options have been added.

Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.

Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)

New flags:
-R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin
-ttt	prints delta times
-tttt	prints times relative to the first frame
-W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w)
-x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

Legal or not, I've seen it done.  Phone records were obtained
in order to *establish* probable cause, rather than as a result of it.
In other words, for a fishing expedition.

 

And does the phone company require written, subpoena-able evidence
of probable cause in order to process the request?  I suggest that
the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you
could prove the offender had called you at a certain time, your 
chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence
are nil.  My contact with several people who have dealt with cases
of extreme phone harassment (several thousand calls in one case) teaches 
me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters.

Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around.

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with
free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic
competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.

I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution

12,"I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile
I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there
seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,
I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some
random 50mV bias.
	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output
won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed
from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input
impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have
maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have
input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to
use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing
reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my
circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.
With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now
with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of
a pain in  the ass.
	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator
input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd
like to have this box not be active.
	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I
had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The
function generator was the same way on that one, too.

	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.





	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't 
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.


	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

10,"Well, I gotta tell ya,

last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU!
It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the
Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils 
were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....

IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His
fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he
created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the
credit away from Gilmour).

I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? 
Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,
Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs
fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well
so far??

Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence,
moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost
at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.
(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't 
remember him having any as of yet.)

Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris

Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last
against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to

All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).  While 
most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who 
are in ""private practice"" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their 
patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get 
your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for 
the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The 
better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's 
plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to 
control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and 
lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but 
I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For 
bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects 
are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing 
a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with 
inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet."

To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,
but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have
merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject
the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without
adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could
be ""Is a polydactyl person a human being?""  You still have not
answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.


You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.
If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,
provide it for me.


More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law
has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does
not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out,
brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant
difference.

What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that
you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when
you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some
ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,
changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,
why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
silly accussations, e.g. ""It really doesn't matter to you...""
If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek
some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person
of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
and show some meaning to your words.


As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on
which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy
fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.
A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore
my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?


Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.


You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is
not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on
for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill
the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.
But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the
other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The
systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling
to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.


Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total
failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in
reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert
that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,
that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,
you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one
hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than
a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins
murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions
are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,
there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to
its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?


You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.


Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and
it is not as slow as you seem to think.


Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that
he was murdered by a religious, ""pro-life"" fanatic.  Please do
try to stay relevant.


Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.

What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?
Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What
is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this
out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one
case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference
between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are
irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction
anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a
healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as
she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at
parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and
the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary
than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive."
7,"No, that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city.

Unless you have an accident, you won't need more.  If you plan on
paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card
automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may
cover rental cars also.

Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and
require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The
credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of
coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.

	There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  It
seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain
themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions
prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.

	If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then
Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that
its soldiers die rather than its children.



	Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is
signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell
the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is
kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.



	Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer
zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while
holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to
those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the

16,"Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the
_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television
station, KTVB Channel 7.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.

Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.

Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that
Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National
Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge
asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because
of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.

The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently
ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither
by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.

The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,
who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person
named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as
an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
in his dealings with Randy Weaver.

Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an
Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two
then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in
time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons
transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, ""He felt like he
(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the
White cause.""

The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and
later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second
meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to
tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-
gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of
19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge
shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of
24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel
length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver
is reported to have said that he could perform better work once
his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility
of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars
for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty
dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have
simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -
over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).

The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that
his ""source"" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead
of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver
suspected he was dealing with an informant, ""I had a guy in
Spokane tell me you were bad.""  Fadeley managed to convince
Weaver otherwise.

The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were
made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these
meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also
reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki
Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must
have also been phone taps.

These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and
loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's
attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to
make sure that the government proved its case, ""...if it has a
case at all..."" according to the rules.

Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his
wife's voice on the tape.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear
accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the
Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect
this trial is not explained.

Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning
Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are
surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were
surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained
in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy
Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that
Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report
that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming
at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics
are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the
only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and
Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that
Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention."

11,"	This is a very good point.  AT&T obviously knew and participated in the
development of the Clipper chip.  This amounts to unfair business practice and
gives AT&T an early monopoly on the market [hopefully a non-existant market].
Other companies that compete with AT&T in the cellular market (Motorola, NEC, etc)
have grounds to file a complaint over this.


It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this
whole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned, the most
difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it, the
average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea.  If
there is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will
provide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is
too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their
own or buy a cheaper one.  I give SCT my full support, and hope the
Clipper chip goes the way of the Beta video tape format.

Also hope they get sued over re-using the name Clipper.

Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.  People who ""just
follow orders"" have tortured and killed others in very large numbers,
and protest their innocence afterwards.

When your authority starts telling you to do things, you should ask
questions.  Except for situations of pressing need (""I said shut the
hatch because the submarine is filling with water!""), any reasonable
authority should be able to give at least some justification that you
can understand.

Just be sure to listen when authority answers.

(If anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and
 following orders, you might want to read about a study done by Solomon Ashe
 in 1951 on conformity, and another done by Stanley Milgram in 1963 on
 obedience.  Both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology.  The
 results are both fascinating and terrifying.)

I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where
the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear
taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced
the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time
I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The
dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to
fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5
years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try
to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent
and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is
getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.
They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they
want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!


""A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
 recent offensive level of performance.""  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in
 the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger
 in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived ""superstars"", who
 get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably
 considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.



Aren't they the same thing?


Either that or just stupidity.


Of course.


One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in
pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media

Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car
Bomb Explosion
 
Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a car
bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and
wounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work of
a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas
exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the
other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an
Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement.
An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may
have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at
the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the
blast suffered light to moderate injuries.



The Arab that was killed was a probably from the Mossad so it is not count 
as a murder.

need to be identified with the entity's name.  The number of entities < 1000

 This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the 
 belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist.
 This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are
 conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have
 to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe
 in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at
 God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan
 except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond
 hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The 
 reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians
 have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.


 How did they shoot themselves in the foot?


  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a 
  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and
  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least
  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this
  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because
  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the
  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict
  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant
  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists
  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).  


 Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist
 doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may
 just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:
 
 Strong atheism - ""I believe god does not exist""   a positive belief

 Weak atheism   - ""I don't believe in a god""       a negative belief
 
 these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of
 god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that
 you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)
 
 suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent
 as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas
 exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person
 not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that
 even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:
 
 christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god
 
 atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)
 
 atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set
 
 agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....) 



 Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not
  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always 
  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival
  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.

Well, almost.... If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were
willing to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I
logged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that
anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up
as the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got
religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers.


Thanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using
several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I
missed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG)
that seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is
fresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my
solution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into
the kernel.


I heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks
were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on
reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay
to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes
a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of
solutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off
the net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K
after compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have
guaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and
still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds."

Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completely
misunderstood what you said.  Also, my math is frequently noted for
being wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.

I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and
one stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes
per second is 1.44K.

Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in
stereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a
Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if
you think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A
converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been
cut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher
frequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome
that problem.)

On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,
you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and
then linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,
but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in
that respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, and
compression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of
less than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musical
sounds, not speech.

Have fun.

The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,
exploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a
ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser
in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through
the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The
sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
draft generation.

It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on
both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at 
locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part
time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.
It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.
Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,
usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically
takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant."

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the NHL.
He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques.

was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!

It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous
goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau
was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the
last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were
caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned
the other cheek...BASTARD!

Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have
gone in.

plenty of chances to capitalize, Muller, LeClair, Haller, etc. but
failed to put the puck in the net.  That's what did them in.  But
Mr. Stewart didn't help matters at all.

My brother's has been trouble free.  Not one single repair, only 
regular maintainance.  The only work he had done on it was a result
of his stupidity... he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn 
on a busy intersection, and was rear-ended.  He has a 1989 Plymouth
Sundance.  I would recomend it, but I would also like to say that if
you can wait about six months, ChryCo is coming out with a new car
called the Neon, that is built in the same way as the LH's where.
Good luck with your desiscion.

14,"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an
informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.
ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and
International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the
company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that
his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.

The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga
to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,
who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which 
the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,
His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought
there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous
satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,
seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of
slots.

The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl
Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions
supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 
70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).
According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the
world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and 
the Pacific Rim. 

RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax
haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to
fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have
cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.
Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began 
negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in 
Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.
Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way
that people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""  
Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the
only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.

Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost
of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg
says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who 
went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was
out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He
again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,
he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the 
Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions
before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to 
allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.

The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied 
Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in 
Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built
about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that
siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest
people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this
point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on
both siberians and midwesterners :-)

Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is 
apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that
would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them 
specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites
that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This
compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1
million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their 
satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They 
have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give
you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are
getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place
now.

Tidbits:

*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big
business because big business is just like what they have over there, except
that ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""

*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch
within 9 months.

*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement
fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,
and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is
sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.

*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried
partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying
monolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry 
because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what
really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.

*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering
money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting
25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in 
rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian
bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that
the only the contractors get swindled by the government.

*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western 
satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type
of satellites, which was rather reassuring.

*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive
technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have
a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare
well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much 
shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the 
difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,
shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer
technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date
hardware.

It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a
case of violence by teenagers...

For a little perspective:

How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
agencies to help children, seniors, the homeless?

Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring
breaks helping out in inner city areas? What about the hundreds of
volunteers ( teenagers and others) who worked to clean up the mess
after the Rodney King riots in LA?

Have you gone to your local high school play recently? Attended the
school orchestra performances? Have you seen how many kids volunteer
to pick up trash, plant trees, do walk-a-thons? How many kids have
tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to? How
many girl scout cookies have you bought? How many chocolate bars for
good causes?

The media picks up on all the anomalies, the sensational...

What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at
school, get good grades, go to college (or to work) and make a real
contribution to our society?

All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives! Mother Theresa
was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer.

It seems to deter those who are executed from future criminal activity.


Why don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes?
Blacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal
system, blacks would be disproportionately represented.

(Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing.  It's probably
an economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks
are more likely to be poor.  The way to reduce the proportion of minorities
in prison is to increase the wealth of minorities.)"

Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more
difficult.  You have not bothered to substantiate this in
any way.  Basil, do you know of any evidence that would support
this?

I can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if Hasan
had been writing it.

Newsflash:
Cairo AP (Ancient Press).  Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red
Sea.  In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of
the Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea.
The action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment.
Egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been
denied their livelihood by the parted waters.  Pharaoh's brave charioteers
were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the
Red Sea to return to their normal state.  Unfortunately they suffered
heavy casualties while doing so.

Do you honestly hold to that tripe Charley? For a start there are enough
current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write
above is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek
Orthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good
old library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared
to a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost
unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been
edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much
more congenial fellow I must say.

used once at 15 ips and carefully stored.  All reel include an Ampex tape
band.  The tape has not been bulk erased to my knowledge.  The history of
the tape in know and available upon request.  JMAR in Toronto sells new

postage.

Did your boyfriend comment on the fact that Clement looks like a
walking ad for Brillo pad hair replacement therapy? The guy's just a
stuffed shirt who thinks he's the greatest hockey analyst since Howie
Meeker (for gosh sakes). I'll take Schoenie any day.

   After hearing about the McGovern House story on Paul Harvey I never had any
idea how much it was worth.  The autograph is on a Senate Pass card
and is signed 'John Kennedy.'  I don't remember if it was signed 
'Senator John Kennedy' or whether or not it was dated, because I haven't
looked at it in quite a while.  Currently it is in a safety deposit box.
I would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction
house such as Christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit. 
If you (or any collector you may know) has an interest in this please send
me an e-mail expressing your interest.  I will see what I can do to make 
a scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers.

4,": Is there a fix for this? We have a Quadra 900 that will NOT finish startup
: unless there is a monitor connected. This would be no problem, but since
: we're running it as a file server, there is no need to have a monitor
: connected all the time.

I've seen a control panel made for this. I don't remember the name, where I
saw it, or on what Quadra models it will work. But I do know it exists :)

15,"My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas
carols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and
heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either -
I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.
        Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how
religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though
I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof -
just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't
definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by
religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to
understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.

        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is
correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian
God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about
people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me -
agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their
beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between
the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do
you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow
a different religion than you would if they were Christian??

        Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in
the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be
stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??

        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are
fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and
'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find
hard is the actual belief in God.

        Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite
believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not
believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why
I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.

        Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came
into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

                        Thanks for the help,
                                Paul Simmons"

I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the 12 Imams with you, although
my preference would be to move the discussion to another
newsgroup.  I feel a philosophy
or religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply
embedded in the world view of Islam and the
esoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter
into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric
religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical
substance of man's being and nature.

A good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory
books to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahhari's ""Fundamental's
of Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe"" - Mizan Press,
translated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book
(if you can find a decent translation) is ""Wilaya - The Station
of the Master"" by the same author. I think it also goes under the
title of ""Master and Mastership"" - It's a very small book - really
just a transcription of a lecture by the author.
The introduction to the beautiful ""Psalms of Islam"" - translated
by William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of
Great Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We
have these books in our University library - I imagine any well
stocked University library will have them.

From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought. You
should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable 
Shi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the
charge of heresy is levelled."

This thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint
according to some utilitarian principle, i.e. atheism/religion is
wrong because it causes death.  The underlying `moral' is that death
is `wrong'.  This is a rather arbitrary measure of validity.

Get some epistemology."

   It's worse than that -- there *is* no such thing as
   a double-blind study on the effects of MSG, by
   virtue of the fact that MSG changes the taste of food in
   a characteristic way that is detectable by the subject and
   that cannot be duplicated by a placebo.

Common! You can easily disguise  to flavor of  MSG by putting  it in a
capsule. Then,  the  study  becomes  a  double  blind of  MSG capsules
against control  capsules (containing exactly  the same contents minus
the MSG).

Read a history book, Fred. And tell me why so many religions command to
commit genocide when it has got nothing to do with religion. Or why so many
religions say that not living up to the standards of the religion is worse
than dieing? Coincidence, I assume. Or ist part of the absolute morality
you describe so often?"

       Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are
verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments
abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid
to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused
in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person
will stop putting his hand on the stove.


       I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell
pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.  

       It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust
the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed
to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies
total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.


       This is very likely.


       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many
people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're
here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is
necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should
have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.
Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more
magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more
heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.


       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,
two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide
rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about
half the per-car death rate.


      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The
fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,
whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally
irrelevent.

      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous
impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.

      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt
to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even
if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.



       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.
(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per 
se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's
countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got
more knives or fists.  

       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.
have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms
of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they
are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is 
violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The
*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of
99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that
you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.


       The situation is not ""good"" in that people fear for their lives.
But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,
protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,
too, lost their livelihoods?


       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.
However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can
be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition
won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.

       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If
you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is
a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully
simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,
as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)


       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.
That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.
Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the
group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.

       You may take that for what it's worth.

Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car
Bomb Explosion
 
Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a car
bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and
wounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work of
a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas
exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the
other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an
Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement.
An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may
have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at
the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the
blast suffered light to moderate injuries.

This is a good point, but I think ""average"" people do not take up Christianity
so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their
social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of
immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the
Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if
they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong
TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it
doesn't hurt anybody...
 

These are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but let's make sure to
alter the scond one so that includes something like ""...let him be, as long as
he is not preventing others from finding their peace."" or something like that. 
(Of course, I suppose, if someone were REALLY ""at peace"", there would be no
need for inflicting evangelism)


Well, it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  Their
popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School,
I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this
time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also
immigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross
generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it
ever has before (since I've been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions
that are chagning.  Who knows?
I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we
have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other:
I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put
arguments on this usenet, it never does any good.  Argumentation does not
really seem to apply to Christians (or even some atheists)- it must simply be a
step the person takes naturally, almost, ""instinctively""...

I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation.
That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like
so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.

I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I
deign from commenting much further.


Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as
many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that
Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if
you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily
being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,
but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.
 

Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*
determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible
human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The 
distinction is subtle yet important.

When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results
are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could
have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,
without sacrificing his convictions.

Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.
Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know
with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the
right direction when he uttered, ""Cogito, ergo sum,"" yet we have not advanced
much beyond that.

Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that
the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely
certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,
you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all
practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with
Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about
absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability 
that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) 
abandon these absolutes.


As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does
not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to 
render all doubts unreasonable.

The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not
mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.
There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I
did not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over
another as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not
preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in
this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.

I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view
of an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that
befalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater
law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the
ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of
Christ can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that
was completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the
flesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental
concepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized
and mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus
Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.
Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the
continuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).
More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,
the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate
resurrection and judgement on the Last Day.

There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the
tenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.
Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma
or that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a
new impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not
refute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of
course, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only
one of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man
himself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his
parents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at
all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of
Christ's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.

There is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John
the Baptist,

   ""If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.""

This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching
either way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to
the human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did
not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (""If
you care to accept it"").  So I took care to point out, not that the
Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and
that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes
understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I
pointedly used ""repeated earth lives"" to distinguish a little from the
oriental doctrines usually associated with the word ""reincarnation"".
The phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too
that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely
free from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, the most important expression of it being Lessing's ""The
Education of the Human Race"".

To return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and
Esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.
And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the
incarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus
Christ, in my view."

11,"Fascinating.  Most of the content of the White House announcements was

take away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face,
and the nice friendly word ""Management"".

			      FACT SHEET
		     PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The first thing it doesn't say is ""We're giving you stronger encryption"".
what it says is 
   the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only
   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust
   than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of
   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the
   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to
   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.
But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,
so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!
*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they
need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search
for the other 40-bit key.

Similarly, it didn't say ""We're making encryption is commercially available.""
because encryption *is* already commercially available, including
forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.
And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were
convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.

The next thing it didn't say is ""We're making encryption legal"",
because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the
President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.
What it *did* say was:
	In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the
	private sector from developing, or the government from approving,
	other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in
	assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.
which clearly means ""We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.
Soon.  Once business buys into this.""

Another thing it didn't say is ""We're going to ask Congress for money
to do *lots* more wiretapping"", because of course, there's a budget crisis,
and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.
What it *did* say was:
   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General
   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.
which means ""We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to
buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO
(that's what ""preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance"" 
means.)  "

   2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?
       I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I

Huh?

IMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the 
other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues.
In Gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some
increase will be seen.  He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump

Now this is getting interesting!

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated
this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some
reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the
resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean
the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:

1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was 
pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right
now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the
""great judgement"" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).
I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the
church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my ""soul""
(which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?

2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms 
that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My
physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my
new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal
so it can be tortured for all eternity?

3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical
place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth?
Do you think we could find it if we dig?

[There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I
think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur
until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the
meantime, some believe that people ""sleep"" until the final
resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death
to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe
that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then.
There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.

The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a
different ""technology"" than the current one, one which is not mortal.
(Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus'
resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not
subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that
there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other,
but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't
think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some
analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the
earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension,
outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little
in the way of details."

Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times ""Tyre vied with Sidon
for first place in the intellectual life of the period""; that Tyre was
the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;
that ""the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia"" was the
basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its
exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,
along with other seaports, ""provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian
and even Chinese trade""; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing
population by ""following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line
of growth"" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre
established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a ""small
fishing village"" by any stretch of the imagination.

Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had ""opulent and flourishing
bazaars"" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was
""noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.""
During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held
by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)

In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: ""other
*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and
Zahlah.""  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of
the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)
on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's
withdrawel in 1984, ""Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local
economy.""

If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,
why is it always called a city (or, above, a ""major city"")?  Why
does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities
in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the
list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?

the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.

A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.
(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They
may even use cars these days. :-) 

The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says ""Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.""  
Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.
(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same
source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,
so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for
the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the
population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In
particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   


I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.
Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to 
the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make
a case for Tyre having been singled out?


They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]:
Tyre ""receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes
and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a
large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...""

The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit
your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems
to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching
when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small
fishing village.


A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.
He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,
_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).
The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the
prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that
I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to
the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.

(I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books
in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so
much at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)"

What do you mean by ""police band"" - there is no such thing.

Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.
If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door
openers in malls would be illegal.

One of the great problems here is that there are too many
ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws
about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well
be laws refereing to ""police bands"", they are almost certainly
local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning,
but incompetent idiots.

Unfortunaltely, laws do not have to be sensible (or even enforceable).
Lawmakers exist to pass laws - and will continue to do so, until
the day where you are faced with death for not doing X, and
amputation of all your limbs for doing X ... the choice will be yours.

To a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists

no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser

DEPOSITION OF LYUDMILA GRIGOREVNA M.

   Born 1959
   Teacher
   Sumgait Secondary School No. 10
   Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10
   Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office

   Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15
   Microdistrict No. 3
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]

[Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in 
 Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights
 organizations - DD]

I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in
Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the
price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide
our lives into ""before"" and ''after."" We talk like that: that was before the
war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole
epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,
it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even 
sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now
. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those
inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our
losses and everything that happened.

Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it
to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would
be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and 
those who didn't.

That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you 
could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was
near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as
my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. 
My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought
that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.

In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the
afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all
our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin
crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel
like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our 
apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in 
his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely 
locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a 
hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people 
who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends
of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.

My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my 
mother, ""Run to the kitchen for a knife."" But Mother was detached, pale, as 
though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never 
expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A 
girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, 
""No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out 
of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.""

We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl 
crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and
Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that 
perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside 
me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to
embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina 
was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to 
say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. 
There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from
excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door
to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time
Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,
but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us 
immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at 
least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their 
eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst
in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They 
came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other 
room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma 
snatched the axe from behind and said, ""Tell them not to touch the children. 
Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children."" She
said this to Father in Armenian.

There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They 
understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, 
they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: ""You and 
your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your 
children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, 
our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,"" and 
so on and so forth, ""and we came to do the same thing to you."" This whole time
some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They 
were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people 
among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, 
all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm 
a teacher.

So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took 
him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,
because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all 
but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were 
doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off 
Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: ""I'm old enough to 
be your mother! What are you doing?!"" He struck her. Now he's being held, 
Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, 
who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying 
to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their 
consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they 
mustn't do it. She said, ""Come on, let's straighten this out, without 
emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we 
ever do to you?"" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come 
into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and 
coming--said, ""What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We 
came here to kill them.""

They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she 
didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, ""What
did we do to you? What did we do to you?"" And even later, when she came to, 
she said, ""Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?""

That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only 
broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they 
were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain 
nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do 
was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they
did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, 
they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but 
didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they 
could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, 
kicking her, using anything they could find.

Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, 
just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they 
did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the
apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the 
corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, ""Let's take her 
outside.""

Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they 
weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time 
I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't 
afraid of what would happen to them.

When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered 
with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several 
times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though 
I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm 
vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold 
a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time 
I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, 
and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me 
""forget,"" you have to forget, you have to go on living.

At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and 
despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found
the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had
to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering 
to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that
he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me
and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over
me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that
they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up
with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a 
really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I 
suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly 
I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I 
just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the 
ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was 
still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,
they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with
their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-
cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.

I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. 
Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't 
need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had 
even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth 
living.

There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman 
pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come 
because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, 
and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to
put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The 
person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, 
because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he 
has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, 
one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, 
even during the investigation he almost called me ""daughter,"" he apologized, 
although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that 
I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my 
words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,
but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never 
forget it.

I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one 
could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of 
beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.
I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.

And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a
couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to 
kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an 
end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into 
the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it 
was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was 
thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her 
and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all 
the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor 
from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a 
little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,
how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, 
""You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,
I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,"" he
says, ""nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and 
think I never shall again."" The door to his apartment was open and he saw 
everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken 
the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He 
saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven
people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the 
brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that 
they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to 
do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I

After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and 
Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even 
remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry ""Marina!"" out to her, but could
not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't
for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus
I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had
told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both
there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell 
right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that
she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad 
that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . 
although her spirit was murdered . . .

At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that 
mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his 
name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, ""Igor,
help!"" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were 
taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and 
Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the 
neighbors.

And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, 
something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.
 
Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, 
they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out 
onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already 
sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone 
said, ""She's already dead, let's throw her out."" When they carried me out onto
the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I 
heard someone say in Azerbaijani: ""Don't kill her, I know her, she's a 
teacher."" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember
whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an 
accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks
Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and
threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and 	I having opened my 
eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had 
been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only 
remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately 
I can't remember anything more.

What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot 
about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too
much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that 
women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,
if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated
very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in 
Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that 
all out later.

Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary 
of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is 
Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,
she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she 
didn't want to endanger him. She said, ""He was there,"" and a little while 
later, ""Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. 
No, it seems like it was he."" I am sure it was he because when he came to see 
us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something 
entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see
us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought 
groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started 
crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting 
us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned 
him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. 
The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is 
right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the 
investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was
told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone 
to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.

Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she 
bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her 
wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's 
lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A 
Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by
his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a 
special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm 
a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that
boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, 
and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. 
After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.

He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, ""Lady, if you give us all the gold 
and money in your apartment we'll let you live."" And Mamma told them where 
the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and 
everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other 
over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one 
another right then.

Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was
black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she 
ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his
mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-
low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, 
halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, 
and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, 
it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.

The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father 
out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,
a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people 
were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, 
everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee
service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, ""I was afraid 
to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the 
threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and 
dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'."" Mamma remembered one of the 
criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, 
out of one eye. She says, ""I realized that my death would come from that 
person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.""
Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.

I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina 
was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all
alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even
though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and
Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.
I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. 
But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones 
I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the 
ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and 
that all of that would die with me.

At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I 
didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that
we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, ""Neighbor, is that
you?"" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived
I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been 
taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to 
take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he
had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he 
started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. 
The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in 
the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the 
presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities 
or not. He said, ""Enough, let's go to the third entryway."" In the third 
entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once 
again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as 
they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they 
found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had 
already taken the other.

Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They
had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over
those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I 
identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an 
Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:
""Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.""
That's just what he said, ""those Azerbaijanis,"" as though he himself were not 
Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, ""I'll drive
them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails
and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41."" 
That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the 
person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened 
to, the ""general,"" said that they were going to the third entryway.

Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. 
Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I
was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. 
He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. 
But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.

I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt 
from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find 
anything. He told me, ""Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the 
neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're 
alive."" He told me all this in Armenian.

Then he returned to the others and said, ""What are you waiting for? Leave!"" 
They said, ""Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her 
yourself. No, we want to do it to."" He urged them on, but gently, not 
coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just
boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went
down to the third floor with them himself, and said, ""Leave. What's the mat-
ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?"" And
he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that 
he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I 
told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really
good terms with them.

We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman 
opened the door and immediately said, ""I'm an Azerbaijani."" He said, ""I know. 
Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows
about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place."" She says, ""Fine,
have her come in."" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I 
had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into 
tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a 
half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, ""Do you know where my family 
is, what happened to them?"" She says, ""No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid 
to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see 
who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian."" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my 
neighbor says, ""You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, 
or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else."" During the butchery in our
apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl
earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was 
still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I 
touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it
to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.

I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I 
don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I 
end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the 
apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. 
I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had 
hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near 
some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. 
Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I 
think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were
broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay 
there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town 
could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were 
burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started
picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport 
jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the
one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. 
And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to 
strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on 
my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me
afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got 
burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was
protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know 
how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if 
I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I 
had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on 
living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I 
thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. 
I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in 
Afghanistan, he should protect her.

While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I
thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would 
she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among 
themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no
children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. 
Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good 
job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was 
all over. They started to argue. A third one says, ""How come you get it? I 
have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. 
All these years I've been living in God-awful places."" Another one says, 
""Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave."" Then someone said 
that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their
place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and
left.

Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite 
frequently, ""Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let 
them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians."" Then they 
said, ""Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!"" They repeated it 
very often.

Oops, maybe not."
14,"Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It
would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.
The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to
ten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the main
spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer
momentum to the ship.

  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion
heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave
into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are
going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,
helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic
radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission
products).

  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much
momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems
to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs
out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once
they're there.

  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

  Thanks.

""Assuming""? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in 
this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never 
addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is 
""right"" or who is ""wrong"", only that civilians ARE being used as cover 
and that, having been placed ""in between"" the Israelis and the guerillas,
they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.
 
	[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms 
	is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that 
	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as
	""combatants"". So, what do you think is the ""meaning behind"", 
	the intention and the effect when an ""army"" purposely 
	*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look 
	like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will 
	receive from this ""cover"" is more important that the harm
	that will come to civilians.*

This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying
that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians
in ""the middle"" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart
from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower
the risk to civilians.

	But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves
	at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves ""why set 
	ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made 
	cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of 
	view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept 
	some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.


I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing
sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND
ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait 
until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that
""taking the fight *to* the enemy"" will do more to stop attacks. 

As I said previously, Israel spent several decades ""sitting passively""
on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*
the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.
The ""host"" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks 
from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks
were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact 
on the civilians caught in their path.  

This is just another ""selectively applied"" statement.
 
The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis
is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your
criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.

That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for 
the ""interim"" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are
demanding conditions that essentially define ""autonomy"" already. They DO
NOT trust that Israel will ""follow through"" the entire process and allow
Palestinians to reach full autonomy. 

Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? 
If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians 
be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?
Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up ""tangible assets 
(land, control of areas) in exchange for ""words"". For this reason,
they are also concerned about the sorts of ""guarantees"" they will have 
that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.

Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the
Israelis ""word"" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being
demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party
finally gets HOLD of this ""land"", what the ""other party"" does
is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,
your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to
keeps its word does NOT get the land back.


While the ""major armaments"" (those allowing people to wage ""civil wars"")
have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still
remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and ""commando""
raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard
for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.


Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks
were commonplace.


There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively ""disarmed"" UNLESS the state
is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take
it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially
mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that
it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.

That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to ""take over""
Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that.
What both ""sides"" need is to receive something ""tangible"". The Arabs/
Palestinians are looking for ""land"" and demanding that they receive it
prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it
gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic
situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN
it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to
compensate for the increased risks"

On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they
should not be spoken of in a ""common manner"" or ""trampled under
feet"" such as the Lords name is today.  The ceremonies are
performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside
as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place.  We believe that the 
ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they
are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the
temple.  So from our point of view, when they are brought
out into the public, they are being trampled under feet,
because of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore
offensive to us.

Hello Motif World,

over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to
the Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have
been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.

This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will
incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support
X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.

Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this
distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.

Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:

HISTORY

The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,
has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++
classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through
member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library
was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.
However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only
worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no
longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.

I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell 
bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and
enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the
general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).

NEW RELEASE

I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++
bindings. 

This release offers:

- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support
- Support for Xbae widgetset 
- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate
  progress in an application.

- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)
- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted
  on Usenet.

WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS

Ftp:

Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.

Note:

Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large
files during working hours.

Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this
is an old version of the bindings.

E-mail:

Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by
e-mail.

REQUEST

Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please
contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of
bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-).

a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd

People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment
to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they
did in Waco.

After all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of
tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.

Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!

We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they
intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population,
we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would
have ever thought it would happen here!

I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.

And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the
2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses
tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.

Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.
Now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a
half of civilians.

       Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the
question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal
to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written
with something else in mind and ""propoganda"" put out by its supporters.

       But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time
you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?

       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really*
means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.


       If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why
on earth did you make a point of calling them ""propogranda?""  That
would seem to be irrelevent.


       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe
they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were
good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because
they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't
think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.


       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political
system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this
particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure
and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)


        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have
had less power?


        Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While
the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although
badly) to the U.S. President.

        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives
is ""in principle"" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)
but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the
Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh
darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put
those extra restrictions on the Senate in?


      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell
you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of
government to ""attack"" which presents them with the best chance of
getting what they want.  With national ""interest groups"" it is simply
a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a
law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less 
""contributions"" to make.  

      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at
the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little
state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,
medicine, and most other questions.

      Local government has not ""failed"" in that it hasn't done what it
should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local
interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their
rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,
only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because
it can impose its will on the lower.

      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres
of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-
and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed
to a local crime?

      The more people want the more Congress will take power to ""sell""
it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of ""special interests""
is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.


       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual
need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher
levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to
in effectiveness.


       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I
remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable
of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if
you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the ""pork"" in that
state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power
and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get
what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.

       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must ""buy off""
states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.


       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself 
that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres
has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact
national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem
is significantly reduced.


       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable
to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering
the government the usually the institution with the sole power to
enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those
decisions a good thing.


       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have
more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution
than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is
harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing
new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out
without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the
entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different
areas, different solutions may be called for.

       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local
and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to
the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the
majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end
up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in
Washington with half a million or more constituents.

       I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels
are more corrupt.  


       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were
arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators
should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was
suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was
nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.
Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders
wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,
I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,
which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for
the House.


       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration
of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other
examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the
reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)


       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something
it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering
the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they
want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying
about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which
almost necessitates its abuse.


       *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of
which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's
anything resembling a record.


       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system
against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when
dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have
not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal
power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to
got through something more than a bare majority


       Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster
to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.


       Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring
60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good*
argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.


       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority
for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population
groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities
should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough
about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority
being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing
the *federal* system against action.

Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist
outside the uteris.  Sometimes this causes problems, often it doesn't.
There is generally no need to remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are
causing other problems.  One lady I know had Endometriosis in an ovary.  
This caused her a _great_ deal of pain.  Another lady I know has an

       Here's a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and
producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be
imported?


       Yet it was done.  Done quite successfully for a number of years.
*Somebody* thought it was worth the risk.


       Your assumption is that this ""low"" dollar/pound area is
sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what
do you base this?  

       And given that smuggling channels are already established,
and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly
more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering
doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than
drugs?


       Now *that* was a jump.  In any case, define ""local.""  It's
a big country.
 

       Wow, you gotta love the speculation.

       As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw
ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and
out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even
have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.  

       I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be
worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed
to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of
every ship which came through.

       It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how
much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood
of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.

   But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as
proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys
if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip,
one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that
break gives you all messages involving that phone.)

   The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you
nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random)
bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using +
for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit
strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is
possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern,
for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives
the cracking agency no benefit.

	Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators
of crimes no more represent the ""Black community"" than racist hateful Whites
represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities
who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe
otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.
	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the
demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,
and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're
going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic
group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors
leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than
not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.
	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few
Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime
statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then
worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable
or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to
define ""us"" and ""other"" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous
when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational
humans.
	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the
*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial
makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in
San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its ""ethnic diversity"". Here, we
have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the ""model minority"") gangs,
and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly
troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their
propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on
the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and
crime are what they most fear. During the ""disturbance"" in Los Angeles last
year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I
remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs
where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned
from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives
that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly
multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that
in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*
riot!
	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points
that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the
racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As
a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem
becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly
believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current
course of denial and repression.
	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,
luck in avoiding the ""trap"". 
	Peace, my brother.

The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current
feeling
is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that
patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation
of
intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small
amounts
of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.  
Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.


The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions.
Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are
avoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the
fudge, though ;-)  .

Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and
informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what
causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but
if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are 
tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's
commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with
severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.

There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed
the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading
to anyone with an interest in Crohn's.

                                             op 26 april 1993


In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de
Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar
eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede
universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste
waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde
in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de
voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350
jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.

De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten
sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,
vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala
aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een
planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal
voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies
Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er
staat echter meer op stapel.

Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een
sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het
symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het
huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten
'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.
Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de
deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van
de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de
eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een
beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,
waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een
half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten
zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot
het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op
een apart vel.
Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars
studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN
ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!

Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed
gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht
Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen
het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van
een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,
in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.
Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel
opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en
trachten te verklaren.
Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de
technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn
namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10
miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30
Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal
er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse
technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.

Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en
f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het
verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening
44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de
ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te
worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving
wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na
31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.

Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I,

Is that what turns you on? The truth needs to be told over and over 
again. There are Armenians who of course witnessed the Armenian genocide 
of 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914-1920 but their voices of truth 
are suppressed today in the hollow din of anti-Turkish/Muslim campaign
by the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle of the fascist 
x-Soviet Armenian Government. Well, that is what I saw in the library.
What's your problem with this?

""It seems that terrorism against their own co-nationals has been a prominent
 part of the revolutionary activities of the Dashnag leaders of the Caucasus.
 Organized to fight the Turks, these chieftains have been more successful
 in their fight against their Armenian opponents in Turkey, and the Caucasus,
 very often defenseless and innocent.""

""The fact remains, however, that the leaders of the Turkish Armenian section
 of the Dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the
 Turkish cause when the Turks entered the war...and a call was sent for 
 Armenian volunteers to fight the Turks on the Caucasian front.""

  I had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their

  Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not 
  be left in independent command of the Moslem population, as, their 
  troops being without discipline and not under effective control, 
  atrocities were constantly being committed, for which we should 
  with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible'.""

 ""In those Moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched 
  for arms by the Armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of 
  such search, and not only had many Moslems been killed, but horrible

  with a few ox-carts, ponies, and donkeys, carrying all their worldly

  Their leader interviewed Bekir Bey, and was told to keep farther on 
  into the hills, where he would be able to cross the frontier into 
  Turkey unmolested by his enemies.""

 ""The arrival of this British brigade was followed by the announcement
  that Kars Province had been allotted by the Supreme Council of the
  Allies to the Armenians, and that announcement having been made, the
  British troops were then completely withdrawn, and Armenian occupation
  commenced. Hence all the trouble; for the Armenians at once commenced
  the wholesale robbery and persecution of the Muslem population on the
  pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms.
  In the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able
  to carry out their purpose, and the manner in which this was done will
  be referred to in due course.""

AZERBAIJAN'S GOVERNMENT APPEALS TO COMPATRIOTS ALL OVER THE WORLD

   BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, Azerbaijan's government appealed 
to Azeris all over the world in connection with escalation of the 
Armenian aggression against the republic.  
  It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting
for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war
against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of 
the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of
Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60
thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place.
This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule,
is said in the document. 
   Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every
effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan,
and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.
   It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine,
food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from
Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the 
sick and the wounded men.--O--


60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES 

     BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar
region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the
Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press
-service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--


SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000
citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar 
went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters
could not land near these villages because of shelling from the
Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop
food and medicine to the encircled people.
   Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to
get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are 
settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja. 
Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical 
aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people.
Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--


ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan, 
situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been
subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About
30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking
part in the attack.
   Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied
the ruling height from where the town is shelled from ""Grad"" installations,
this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20
people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--


PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region
of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief
of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.
   Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that
International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical
aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and
medical aid.
   Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought
on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan
intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life
all over the world for help.
   Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression 
of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed
its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.
   Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under
CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of 
Armenia against Azerbaijan.
   Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of 
Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference
in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of
Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--


AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed
in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of
Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by
Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by
Azerbaijani society ""Dayag"".--0--


PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW

   BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of ""Sadval"" society picketed before
the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow.
Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed
by Azerbaijan.
   Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified
this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic
conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan
correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the
Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti-
azerbaijani action of the ""Sadval"" society in Moscow. He also
marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in
the whole.
   Society of Lezghins, ""Sadval"", registered in Moscow in 1990,
demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed
before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--


ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of 
Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs 
the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.
   In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of 
the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army
retreated several kilometers.
   Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of 
Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army
and local citizens, today.--0--


STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan 
issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the
region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.
   It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed
forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .
  Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the
territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at
present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.
   Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper)
Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a
specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of 
Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked
in the document.
   It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian
army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on
the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful
solution to the conflict.
   It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia 
have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.
   The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop
Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions
against the aggressor.--0--

                  RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION

10:06 A.M. EDT
             
             
             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to
you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio
station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to
meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,
health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly
broadcast with the American people. 
             
             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when
it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past
seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with
the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus
tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last
year's campaign.
             
             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with
you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and
what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting
to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.
             
             You sent me to Washington to get our government and
economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad
experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important
it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do
business.  
             
             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations
rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness
of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the
cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,
labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the
industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've
made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which
our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them
have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been
falling behind.
             
             We have an economy today that even when it grows is
not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation
by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to
show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have
stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks
and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating
cost of health care.
             
             But we also know that, given the right tools, the
right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and
businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy
needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better
places to live.
             
             In many critical products today Americans are the
low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that
we create more of those kinds of jobs.
             
             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for
long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old
priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to
be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs
and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the
waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious
resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the
groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.
             
             These new directions passed the Congress in record
time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our
country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would
create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private
sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It
now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. 
But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the
Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know
would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.
             
             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. 
Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and
counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill
has been grounded by gridlock.  
             
             I know the American people are tired of business as
usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin
or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have
taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra
mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25
percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  
             
             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million
Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill
languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean
hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to
act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking
this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I
think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant
portion of our original goals.
             
             First, we want to keep the programs as much as
possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,
including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young
people, immunization for children, construction of waste water
sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding
for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who
have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't
creating jobs.
             
             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs
in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40
percent.
             
             And third, I've recommended a new element in this
program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against
crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire
police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put
them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight
for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it
and deserve it.
             
             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --
the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it
increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this
year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,
doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more
than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this
budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the
Congress this year.
             
             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators
who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous
administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of
emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the
American people to work.  
             
             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered
a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities
are -- on people or on politics.  
             
             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar
for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the
soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our
children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs
and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of
us when we've helped make more American partners working to
ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.
             
             You know, if every American who wanted a job had
one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this
country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first
step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country
again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid
for over the life of our budget.
             
             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how
important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.
             
             Good morning, and thank you for listening."

This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something.
As a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous
is going around, I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case.
When I do get really sick, it is always something unusual.

This was not the situation when I was in medical school, particularly on
pediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself, and when I went on the
pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious
challenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid
months of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!

I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly
exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later
on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us,
so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is that
the immune system is hyped up in any way. Also, don't forget that the
hospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of that
around."

	Nonsense.  First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water
(that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the
cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes

   I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders.
It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology,
and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the
proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what
exists now.
 
   The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to
concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA
has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,
probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the
existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of
possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)
a DES keysearch machine.
 
   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination
could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since
it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked
jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency
or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used
to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-
nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would
trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for
(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the
complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars
to build a keysearch machine for.)
 
   How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of
the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about
home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers?
""Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately.
Maybe I can help...""
 
 
   Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely
as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant
to ""practical cryptanalysis.""  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how
several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite
security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And
NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of
police organizations and courts across the land."
11,"
Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless
you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
escrow houses.  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is
the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about
those two names)

In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this
system.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the
current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody
with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed
as an ""oh goody"" step upwards.

And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now.

It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's
just an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.  All tapping would need
a warrant, or a breach of security at the escrow houses."

	True (especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature).



	Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE
have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice
while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity
is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately
are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more
battery power.  

	Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they
are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators."

you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with
no restraints. Yes? No?
	Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a
kibbutz? I never studied it on depth, but from what I've heard, the kibbutz
in Isreal was very successful. It is also very close to what Aristotle
and Socrates believed was the best.

But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human
condition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't 
improve their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians 
who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives. I can deal
with that. All I'm saying is that improving the human condition must
be the PRIMARY goal of any organization.

                 Network and Distributed System Security

        3-4 February 1994, Catamaran Hotel, San Diego, California

The symposium will bring together people who are building software and
hardware to provide network or distributed system security services.
The symposium is intended for those interested in practical aspects of
network and distributed system security, rather than in theory.  Symposium
proceedings will be published by the Internet Society.  Topics for the
symposium include, but are not limited to, the following:

*  Design and implementation of services--access control, authentication,
   availability, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation
   --including criteria for placing services at particular protocol
layers.

*  Design and implementation of security mechanisms and support
   services--encipherment and key management systems, authorization
   and audit systems, and intrusion detection systems.

*  Requirements and architectures for distributed applications and
   network functions--message handling, file transport, remote
   file access, directories, time synchronization, interactive
   sessions, remote data base management and access, routing, voice and
   video multicast and conferencing, news groups, network management,
   boot services, mobile computing, and remote I/O.

*  Special issues and problems in security architecture, such as
   -- very large systems like the international Internet, and
   -- high-speed systems like the gigabit testbeds now being built.

*  Interplay between security goals and other goals--efficiency,
   reliability, interoperability, resource sharing, and low cost.

This can be caused by two one of two things.  The first and easiest to fix is
interference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or
other electrical device.  Try moving the system to another location to fix
that problem.

Second, because of the scan rate of the monitor, it tends to synchronize with
room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing.  Try turning off
all lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.  If not,
try moving the system somewhere else.

A third solution would be to get a 14"" Apple Color Display - It should not
have the same problem the 12"" Color is more suceptible to.

7,"an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to
""sport"" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets
the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does ""sport""
mode entail?  several things:

1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)

2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the
	low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and
	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's
	another curve approaching)

3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is
	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern
	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.
	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about
	to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as
	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.

also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage
than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that
the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a
big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to
use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an
inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a
5 speed)?  

how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best
gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will
be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with
all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do
better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved
wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,
low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high
revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if
one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.

Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17"" monitors recently
and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if
you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality.
This monitor can be had for around $1070.

Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a
17"" monitor and was going to consider the Mitsubishi. If I remember
correctly, I think its viewing area is 16"" measured diagonally.

Thanks.

I totally agree with that sentiment.  But why do you have to go further

you have not answered from Scripture.  You can worship on every day, as

There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas
Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a
professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy ""you're not in
Kansas anymore"" Denning).  The article was titled ""Government slowly
eroding our liberties"", and in it he tells a story attributed to the
late Leonard Read who

        explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from
        Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read
        said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and
        then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that
        as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.
        You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it
        up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being
        cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.
        If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we
        would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as
        with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken
        a little bit at a time.

The last line of the article says, ""It's not too late for us, but the
water is getting pretty warm.""  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the
Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

       The Republicans are, in general, fighting any tax increase.
There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase
incrementally.

       (BTW, what is different between Canada's tax and most of
Europe's that makes it ""visible?"")


       This would require a constitutional amendment, and Congress
enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that.
(Besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you'd 
have a difficult time ""forcing"" anything like that.)


       Primarily because it's a practical impossibility to ""freeze""
tax rates.

       However, this is something that bothers me.  We're always talking
about ""consumer confidence"" and ""consumer spending"" as gauges for the
economy.  If they really are important, wouldn't shifting taxes to
consumption provide a disincentive to spend money?

17,"WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi 
SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to ""the extermination of the
Jewish race""--went on display Friday at the National Archives.
	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are
among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the
Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.
	""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe,
a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He was
supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his
own rules.""
	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped
would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after
World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.
	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than
100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you,
quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be
mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.
I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish
race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been
written and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje]
	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as
""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*.
	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation""
or ""tearing up by the roots.""
	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,
""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archives
officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually
spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.
	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of the
Jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.
	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is
a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum here on April 26.
	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of
Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and
an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.

  In a word, yes.  I don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of
impact on the power of God.  In the past, God gave us the ability to create
life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life
through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely 
cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to
approach the glory of God.
  The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we
will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality
unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!
  No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't
impinging on God's power.  It's only when we attempt to gain control of the
spiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and 
logic, that we begin to interfere with God."

5,"A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set
up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should
never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having
some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models
my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable
from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is
called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the
old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below,
main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents
the interface to the library function.

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top)

        int junk = 0;
        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,
                                        NULL);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(""blaaa"", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        topone,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(topone);
        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when ""Exit"" button clicked
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }
        XtDestroyWidget(box);
        XtCloseDisplay(dis);
}

// SetItUp - should be called once only
void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top)
{
        int junk = 0;
        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, ""test"", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);
}

// doit - some library function callable from the outside
void doit()
{
        static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called
        static Widget top;

        static int setup = 0;

        if (!setup)
        {
                SetItUp(&app, &top);
                setup = 1;
        }
        bla(app, top);
}

// main - program which links to my library
main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
        {
                doit();
                printf(""sleeping...\n"");//widget still on screen at this point
                sleep(5);
        }
}


The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.
(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the ""sleep"" in the main prog,
despite the XtDestroyWidget call).

Anyone see something I'm missing?

Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight
bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody
fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws
that exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent is
his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The
national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to
sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights
until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!
The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their
sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights
who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right
to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even
if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. Go
read your constitutional law. We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment
campaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. So many went to jail
and for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK.

Tammy, is this all explicitly stated in the bible, or do you assume
that you know that Ezekiel indirectly mentioned? It could have been
another metaphor, for instance Ezekiel was mad at his landlord, so he
talked about him when he wrote about the prince of Tyre.

Sorry, but my interpretation is more mundane, Ezekiel wrote about 
the prince of Tyre when we wrote about the prince of Tyre.

This is similar to my saying that Clinton's timber summit does little to
fix the health care problem.  Look at the whole picture, not just
randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to
use ""non-initiated force"" to achieve its goals, than no special interest
can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.

The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education
monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government
reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants ""embrace"" libertarianism.
That's the best means I've seen yet.  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]

bit the bullet. I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power
light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years.

How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is
the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to
have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from
time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck???

They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale ""movie"" of
Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little
grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it
had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.

I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many 
other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what
kind of software/hardware was used for creating the ""movies"" I saw but the guy
that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.  But as
I said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could you

You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about
his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book
""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,
not a Muslim.


Regarding Bernard Lewis:

Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his
giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.

Read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.

In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).


I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and
have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his
political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic
polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based
on telling half-truths.

Again, read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take
what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get
this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for
_yourself_.


If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some
Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual
purposes is necessarily opposed too.


I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_
who are not getting through to _you_.

Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.

Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,
showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been
completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a
very good one, under the title ""Islam and Women"", reposted from
soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,
then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this
excellent article.  

IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.

Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,
which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based
completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and
hadiths to support its point of view.

Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical
standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an
and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform
a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is
part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of
course not.

Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for
you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says ""I am a
Muslim"" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean
that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and
only an idiot would think so.

Do you see my point?


You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an
ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise
their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.
To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --
Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be
capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a
free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of 
capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)


One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is
because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.

Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the
fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that
Islam => lack of education and power.

For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a
significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in
the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is
completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history
shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be
other reasons for this situation.


Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent
of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not
knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are
following the Qur'an or not.


The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one
stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by ""following the Qur'an""
that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis
that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical
fact which contradicts your theory. 


You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.
So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is
quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views
makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of
this.


I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.


Here too.


Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate
ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly
with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I
think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!

Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that
you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start
thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our
postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously
have."

""fete""??? Since this word both formally and commonly refers to
positive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling.
 

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are
abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there 
*is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in 
Gaza.  

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying 
entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements
that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. 
Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses
(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are 
inherently in conflict.

Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third 
alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish ""dhimmi""
system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly ""protected"" citizens.
Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with
regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?
 

It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan
""Final Solution"" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish
""Final Solution"". Do you favor one? neither? 

Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel
and Arab/Palestinian ""final solution"" intentions exist, isn't it
important that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan ""rights""
be secured?

""I know nothing about statistics, but what significance does the

This is not small. A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies
a doubling in 69/2.7 \approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people
seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists,
for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates,
but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things
like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation,
and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's

the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards

Do you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian?  I'd hardly

one another.  Love your neighbour as yourself.  Love your enemies.  Is Jesus
Christ their Lord and Saviour?  By the persecution of Jews, they are violating
all the precepts of what Christ died for.  They are in direct violation of
the teachings of Christ.  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders
of that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their
sins.  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else.

	Then let me ask you for a ""workable"" solution.  We have a name

	My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler
for ""meaning"".  In my ""reality"", psychoactives *technically* could 
range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more
standard recreational drugs.  In practice I had hoped to see it
limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like
some of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*
recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive 
effects -- the recent query about ""bong water"", I thought was a bit
off topic -- so I just hit ""k"".

	But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution --
what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to
discuss?  It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something
similar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to
describe alot of those drugs.  There is a big difference between a
drug that if taken in ""certain doses, over a period of days may have
a psychoactive effect in some people"", vs. many of the drugs in

I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might
wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it.
As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks
on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you
count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally
think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires
organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.
Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was
so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone
organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause
for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the
'Zionist' camp.


Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start
with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something.
And the previous posters were wrong, no?


Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think
war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command
and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you
sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds
like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

Oh PULLEEZE!

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is
generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been
in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with
pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were
virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better
pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty
hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're
dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a
purse.

If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the
manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think
manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's
an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described
what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the
need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry
lost millions.

From a woman who would rather buy men's clothing WITH decent pockets and
long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....

Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics.
And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at
8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically
designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen
IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times
it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When
you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it
at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,
none of them run at CPU speed.

The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to

get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.

3,"I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0

The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine
had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.

When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I
would not even know how to do that.

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number
for Western Digital might just do as good!

You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be
contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction
and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?
What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that
Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?
This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically
stood by the Pope.

It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is
disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over
authority and discipline.  

My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:

  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms
  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that
  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX
  don't jointly make such  choice.)

If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.
If I adopt the view that ""I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and
there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours"", that
I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.

The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction
viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical
Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines 
regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of
the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into
the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that
a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games
like ""He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does
is effective..."".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.


We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the ""real""
traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter
East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.
 

I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow
error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`
I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)

What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement
regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how
do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?
Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.
Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,
one way or the other.


It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the
Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.
 

True enough.


One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction.
I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

Hardly.  The ""established"" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.
The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team
could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did
was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-
olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-
er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly
debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-
bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people
played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe

we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions
of their ""real"" reasons.


But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was
going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly
the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily
concede that ""ridiculous reasons"" can play an important role in how

Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When
graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,
presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the
area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft
doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes
'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)
envelope'. 

Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually
flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are
are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots
do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the
correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in
essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where
the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is
done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally
carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how
far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,
such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed
taxi tests).

including a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in 
the trunk.  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would
not retract.  So I ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced; 
$90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket
which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that
when I proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the 
covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.

more later.  Considering how common a problem it is I hope every one

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*
track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.

I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

Hope this helps."

  But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just
roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the
Escrow agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if
this thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from

  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered
to that serial number, either:

  1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going to
do?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy?
All they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.

  2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series.
(This part is really scary.  Since the ""expectation"" is that all
chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and
S2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give
access to all.)

  3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered
without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the
scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to
decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one
of these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated
key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the
conversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to
recover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the
header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the
phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the
same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by
talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then
apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target
keys.)

    Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones.
Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide

[Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ.
Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't
seen the FAQ lately to check.]


Two ways:
 
 1) When you start the xterm, you can use command line options:
         -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label
         -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title
         -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE

 2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:

    The basic escape sequence is:
	ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL

    where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters,
    <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending
    on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,
    or both, and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string.

    Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:
         echo ""\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    To set just the icon title:
         echo ""\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    To set just the window title:
         echo ""\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,
    depending on how the echo command works on your system
    and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics
    under Bourne or Korn shells).

    [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of
    /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have
    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string
    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]

    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show
    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll
    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out
    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.
    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence
    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...

I hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:

The BATF has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in
innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  I will
NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment,
the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence
(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault
a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting
negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms
and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have
very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco
issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with
no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then
the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent
in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,
murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend
the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault
on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,
the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for
BATF wrongdoing.

btw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.

Could be. There is a Jayson Stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate 
and also for Baseball America.


Stark has done this sort of thing, but he has never been serious about it.
He usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of 
such columns. I think he did it one season and some manager was ""projected"" 
to be thrown out of 60 games and some hitter could expect to be plunked 
150 times.

No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in
polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the
modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by
the modem.


Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other
hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport 
( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,
you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be
used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.

[insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little

OK.  The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've
announced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time
Jesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  ""I tell you the
truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He
will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the
Father.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may
bring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and
I will do it."" (John 14:12-14)
So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time,
the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other
beings, but from Jesus.  Remember that ""there is one God and one
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as
a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time."" (1
Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, ""there have been many of those priests [talking
about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from
continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a
permanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who
come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.""
(Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus
being our mediator rather than any other man.

It can be painless, so it isn't cruel.  And, it has occurred frequently
since the dawn of time, so it is hardly unusual.


But, innocents die due to many causes.  Why have you singled out
accidental or false execution as the one to take issue with?"
19,"Mr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas,
rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases
those scholars opinion on the subject:


and 


Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word ""apacgw,"" you will
find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent
reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I
recently checked several Lexicons:

	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida
	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""
	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm
	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale
	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher

A couple simply stated ""hanged oneself"", and a couple were more explicit 
and stated that ""apacgw"" means specifically ""kill yourself by hanging."" A
couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for ""apacgw"" is
""strangle, throttle or choke"" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best
references though, ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New
Testament,"" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the
literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also
other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give
further context).  

The word ""apagchw"" has two root words: ""gchw"" is the ""to strangle"" root, and
the root word ""apo"" means literally ""away."" This root words is included in
words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the
greek word ""apagello"" means to send a message).  ""Apo"" can also denote a
change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson
specifically makes comparison to the word ""apokteiuo,"" which means ""to kill.""
In literal meaning the word ""apacgw"" means ""to throttle, strangle to put out
of the way,"" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from
life, to death).  So while the word ""apacgw"" does mean ""to hang,"" it
specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he
state that it means ""to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging."" He then
notes the the use of ""apacgw"" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He
presents that example of ""apacgw"" as being used to explicitly mean ""suicide by
hanging."" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the
added denotation of ""death,"" and as you insist that the Bible was written by
God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete
meaning of ""apacgw"" (ie: Since the word ""apacgw"" was used, then death is
denoted as the result). 

By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of ""apacgw"":


Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to
Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie"" the the
Hebrew say ""and died""), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. 
It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added ""and died"", the
correct translation would still be ""apacgw,"" as the man did indeed die from
strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the
Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions
which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily
executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it
now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove
your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing
""apacgw"" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding evidence. 

Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it
one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,
I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above
what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or
historical source to justify it. 

By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:


Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that
there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description
of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to
assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
thousand years ago (after all, things change). 

Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same
as the 30 silvers:


True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal
""an iniquity,"" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'
actions ""an iniquity"" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took

    ""Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling
     him ""Buy what we need for the feast""; or that he should give something
     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and
     it was night.""

Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money
box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different
book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. 

Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen
evidence that ""apacgw"" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was
successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because
Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:
Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next day.  Thus the money which bought the ""Field of Blood"" would have to
have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver
that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I
believe that the house of cards is comming down). 

Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on
Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.

By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the
mention of it in Matthew), you say:


I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we
are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping 
these issues.

I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers
have the right to a dark, uncluttered night sky.

Let me give you an example.  When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay
for the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don't like
it, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a
floating billboard out there, you can't turn it off.  It's the same 
reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.

George.

	It's called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry.
If ytou don't like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include
a constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government
here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental
civil rights.

I say: 
	Any reasonably in-depth perusal of American history will show
	you that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice,
	discrimination, and violence against others of different
	races, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.

If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation
to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected
in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you
know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,
they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent
you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.
In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.

I say:
What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably,
would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislating
at all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and
would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
aesthetic values that make us human.  This includes the need for wild
and unspoiled things, including the night sky.

Not necessarily --- they could release the details of the algorithm
without releasing the ""system key"" (called SK by Hellman).  That would
make most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure
before key exchange, the ""official"" chips would only work with other
""official"" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes ""physically
identical clone versions"" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't
be necessary.

Of course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK ---
since all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal.
Personally, I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one ""secret""
80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security.
Of course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system
is compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true
with a secret algorithm.

Incidentally, what's to keep a ""secret algorithm"" from using the secret
SK as the main key, with UK being only marginally important.  Then
a court order for UK may not even be necessary to do a wiretap.

Good question.  I don't have a nice concise answer, though.  What about the
child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr
doing something they greatly dislike.  It is the same kind of harm, and
is probably ""caused"" by the same thing:  The desire of the child to be 
true to his or her self.

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man
occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual
world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through
history.  The Greek, for example, could say, ""better a beggar in the land
of the living than a king in the land of the dead."" (Iliad, I think).

The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is
an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam
or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their
sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile
humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to
him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom
Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.


It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The
relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely
extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine
an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the
spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.

It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous
were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness
that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with
the sense world.

It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient
people's ideas of life after death.


Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at ""the turning point of
time"" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and
we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new
revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new
vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains
something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and
much more as well.

(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf
Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my
views on this subject).


The way you refer to it as ""doctrine"" puts a modern intellectual coloring
on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually
concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or
teachings today can be received.

I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to
simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed
on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception
and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of
expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately
after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In
any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,
but by contemplating the principles themselves.

On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity
that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the
human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is
created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas
dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does
today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same
time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our
eternal spiritual being had grown dim.


Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal
irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in
which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a
single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the
reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in
terms that did not try to spell it out.

You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia,
and I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially
if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's
away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica,
then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed
Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two
seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they
both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!


Like I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I
want. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly
sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite
AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:

	1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike
	  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an
	  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem
 	  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on
	  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20
	  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the
	  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score
	  being reported on WIP.

	2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss
	  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have
	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.
	  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely
	  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.

0,"This (frayed) thread has turned into a patented alt.atheism 5-on-1
ping-pong game, and I don't have any strong disagreement, so I'll try
to stick to the one thing I don't quite follow about the argument:

It seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the Bible
was ""enlightened for its times"" (i.e. closer to what we would consider
morally good based on our standards and past experience) on the one
hand [I hope this summarizes this argument adequately], and on the
other hand:


}|> }Disclaimer:  I'm speaking from the Jewish perspective,
}|> }where ""the Bible"" means what many call the Old Testament,
}|> }and where the interpretation is not necessarily the
}|> }raw text, but instead the court cases, commentaries

}|> This seems the crux to me: if you judge the Bible according to a long
}|> line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day,
}|> rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact, then of course
}|> it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values.
}
}But if that's how the Bible is actually being used today,
}shouldn't that be how we should judge it?  If most people
}use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports
}test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though
}scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?

That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching
Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this
highly-interpreted version is what was ""enlightened for its times"".
To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the
original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for
their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even
heard of paper.

I'm not arguing that the Bible is ""disgusting"", though some of the
history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is
full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are
worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand,
I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible
shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it
to attack condemnation of the original history."

 As you have presented it, it is indeed an argument from incredulity.
However, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner.
It is usually presented more in the form, ""And *besides*, I cannot see...
...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation.""
 Moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such
phenomena. That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not
an argument in theism's favor. Especially when different theisms offer 
different explanations, and even different adherents of what is purportedly
the same theism give different explanations...


 Not im my experience. In my experience, the most common reason is the

The problem with ""Let's assume"" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme
(and you're close), you arrive at ""Let's assume this is perfectly OK.""

The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then
why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty
of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure,
so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but
I certainly can't think of any honest ones.

Next, you assume we can ""trust"" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked,
EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure,
corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is
saying ""Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.""  Bullcrypt. 

And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume
that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case
in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately
fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this
score.

Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others
have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure
encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand.
Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this
expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra
cash...

The following is more true than ever:

  Damn right you can't provide any evidence for it.  

  Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a

  that it reflects your socialization and religious background, as
  well as your need to validate your religious beliefs.  Were I to

Try the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.
It's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.

They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software
engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,
and some stuff about comms.   

The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and 
X Windows programming as well)
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending
on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.

The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought
invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -
this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough

Playoffs:

*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme
by Rick Sadowski, Daily News

Barry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the
crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with
the rookie goaltender.

""I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most
fun time of the year, and I'm not,""  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  ""I
think I have worked hard enough for that.""

Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie
in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays
6-3 opening victory.

But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick
Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the
stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.

Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was 
yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.

Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup
again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic
Saddledome popcorn.

""If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I
dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?""  Stauber wondered.  ""Not that I'd be
happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the
playoffs.""

Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not
convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.

While insisting he is the Kings' ""goalie of the future,"" Melrose said Stauber
flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,
according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New
York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to 
Vancouver on Thursday.

""Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could
have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,"" Melrose said.  ""An
elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a
great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.""

""I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've
got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything
is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect
more from him than he does.""

Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the
team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed
off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.

""I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,"" said Stauber,
a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only 
to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.

""What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated
disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do
expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.""

""Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry 
doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm
a perfectionist.""

Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. ""But 
even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's 
a bit of a jump,"" he said.  ""You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game 
you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 
and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain 
to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I 
do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.""

Melrose's ""goalie of the future"" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. ""Before
you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,"" he said.

This is cute, but I see no statement telling me why your church is the true

Attempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something ""better"" is 
a real good way to loose a person completely from Christ.

We might get further if we begin by accepting that the government 
really couldn't be bothered less about the political opinions of the 
right wing pro establishment types. Just about the only circumstances 
in which I could think that they would be interested in their political 
views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give
the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the 
socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. 


Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which
the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force
lets try thinking.

In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as
a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush
was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook 
remember.

Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply ""ask"" their
chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be ""nice""
boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the
chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.

Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the
same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know
this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and 
Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show 
trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialism
and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.
It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.

the FBI will perform the actual tap.  [It will encourage the *FBI* to
commit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]

But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  When
the EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made, they should ask for details
on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or 
even already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now
and the projected future. 

From these figures, estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBI
is expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basis
with the amount of tapping now known or suspected.

Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more
Clipper-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built and
installed ... ie, get the ""plus or minus"" epsilon for the near future.

Might be a mite disturbing for J. Q. Public to know these things.

And despite all the technical details [BTW, thanks to those who've been
providing them!], we still don't know 

1) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated (though
   it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme).

2) how the results will be securely transmitted (Fed Ex the audio tapes?)

3) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete."

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-

The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to
fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit
at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.
But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.
  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,
and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask
me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I
can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by
existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and
we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries

The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language
courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and 
Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses 
each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin 
June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours 
per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  
Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact 
Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology
Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or
address below.  
ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.

#######################################################################


            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new
program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon 
University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific 
communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and 
January 1994.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the 
United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers
experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is 
facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and
laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop
long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.


PROGRAM DESIGN
To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to 
develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and
its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:

1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE
Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses
designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a
relatively short time.

2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE
A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the
cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in 
manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a 
variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,
Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums
will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or 
research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.


3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN
Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, 
participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,
and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan
will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.


FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS
STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

 President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President 
Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:

1:36 P.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law
against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled
weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.
Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day
standoff ensued.

     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without
bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were
dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably
insane.

     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both
federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,
responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the
action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination
towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no
provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal
agents against the compound.

     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on
an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on
Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.
The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even
in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause
permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people
in the compound to come outside and to surrender.

     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I
discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I
thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what
she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the
implementation of the decision.

     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.
Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal
agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his
captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not
survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate
responsibility for the carnage that ensued.

     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the
future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and
Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to
uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been
dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent
professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I
expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required
to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to
cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can
continue to be fully accountable to the American people.

     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney
General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the
front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult
circumstances.

     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry
for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end
of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be
tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David
Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over
the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult
situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will
be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future
will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what
has been learned now.

     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,
after 51 days, you decided --

     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is
that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation
with --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go
first and then the other.

     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I
can't do it at once.

     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about
the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General
that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another
step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she
described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted
to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause
permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it
very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was
hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.

     I was further told that under no circumstances would our
people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to
shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and
there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful
lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.
There were no shots coming back from the government side.

     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I
asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons
I was given were the following:

     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the
federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the
quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be
needed in other parts of the country.

     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had
never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced
that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to
be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult
members to come out.

     Number three, that the danger of their doing something
to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with
the passage of time.

     And number four, that they had reason to believe that
the children who were still inside the compound were being abused
significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and
unsafe conditions.

     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.
The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had
given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and
evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said
that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were
convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only
increase with the passage of time.

     The third question I asked was, has the military been
consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,
that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious
that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military
people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some
of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the
military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they
had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one
minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military
-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming
significance.

     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I
said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she
should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that
today.

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.

     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --
reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were
trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only
reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only
reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to
add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather
late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who
had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into
custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events
to unfold.

     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people
speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General
on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.
I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry
King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it
is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that
happen when the federal government is in control.

     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised
would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the
Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics
murdered themselves.  (Applause.)

     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this
life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These
people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were
heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,
and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to
avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate
themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the
children.

     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,
is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you
to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why
you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she
said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those
children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly
unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier
with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for
that.  So that is where I think things stand.

     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was
mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of
patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really
decide that way?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume
is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has
done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of
time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the
World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry
to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we
should have known?  Is there some other question they should have
asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say
for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make
the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want
the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have
some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but
totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best
evidence we have.

     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of
fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it
again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,
particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is
important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the
people who killed others and then killed themselves.

     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options
presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from
February 28th until yesterday?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all
along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go
back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good
job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued
any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them
early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of
the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to
be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the
authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things
just began to spin downward.

     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened
yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not
involve other options except whether we should take more time with
the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they
wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get
people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.
That's what they thought.

     Q  Did the government know that the children did not
have gas masks?

     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are
you in agreement with that?

     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do
whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the
Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring
in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any
congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully
cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the
most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the
country."

Windows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who
think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to 
be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows
users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for 
granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 
3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even 
a real issue. My ideal operating system:

	Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize
	binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have
	bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...

	Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac 
	and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which 
	has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 
	80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.
	Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.

	Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton 
	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform 
	or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.
	so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on 
 	my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.

	Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS
	or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.

	Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have
	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.

In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean
kernel so you can actually understand it. Anyone know of something like this ?

ABOUT THIS POSTING
------------------
This is a (still rather rough) listing of likely questions and
information about RIPEM, a program for public key mail encryption.  It
(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc
VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a
variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific
to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.

This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply
with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy
manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know
what you think.

DISCLAIMER
----------
Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything
other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk
to a real lawyer.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------

1)  What is RIPEM?

 RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using
 the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your
 electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who
 sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except
 the intended recipient.)

 RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.
 Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,
 which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.

2)  How can I get RIPEM?

 RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is
 considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution
 to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or
 Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README
 file:

 #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution
 #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,
 #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.

 Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
 included with the distribution.  You should read it before using
 RIPEM.

 The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will
 reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the
 humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the
 friend.

 RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents
 in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for
 info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and
 does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.

 RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on
 rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the
 U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out
 how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file
 GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree.

3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?

 Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of
 Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice
 Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports
 are expected, and help of users is invited.

4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?

 Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users
 guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM
 with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.
 Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU
 Emacs.

 If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one
 in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
 and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.

5)  What is RSA?

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means
 that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
 you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your
 decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it.  (Note that the ""message"" sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real message. (See ""What is DES?"")

 Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,
 the fingerprint of the message (See ""What is a fingerprint, like
 MD5?"") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can
 use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message
 must have come from the sender.

 RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who
 invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in
 pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.

6)  What is DES?

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or
 secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.

 RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it
 should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future
 RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using
 multiple encryption with DES.

7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.

 RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not
 handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.

8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
 your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important
 that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.

 RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
 the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are
 described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.
 None of them provide perfect security.

9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?

 RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various
 characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in
 your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.
 This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the
 same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the
 same length, etc.

10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?

 MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.
 It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
 of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,
 instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,
 only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.

 MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.

 MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in
 RFC 1321.

11)  What is PGP?

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.
 PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.
 PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.

 Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:

 - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without
   a direct network connection.

 - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of
   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible
   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with
   PGP 2.0.)

 - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security
   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.
   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,
   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims
   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in
   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original
   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:

   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, 
   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public
   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is
   #contraband.  

 - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites
   in Europe and other places.

 Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.

 Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export
 restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it
 shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents
 differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably
 seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in
 misc.legal.computing.  (See:  ""DISCLAIMER"")

12)  What about RPEM?

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,
 but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in
 an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark
 Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.

 Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
 (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent
 was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested
 in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.
 This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not
 challenged for pragmatic reasons.

 RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.

13)  What is MIME?

Diaspora 'a cancer'
------------------- by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in:
Jewish Chronicle, London, 22. Dec. 1989

Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,
launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth
Council meeting in North London, last week.

The diaspora, he claimed, ""was the cancer connected to the main
tissue of the Jewish people"". He was scathing about its failure to
act before the Holocaust.

He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had
ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed
Zionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, ""the failure
of Judaism"".

His talk, entitled ""Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution"", covered 5,000
years of Jewish history.

Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he
said ""not staying [in Israel], but running [away]"", and all Jews
outside Israel ""who were using other people's countries like
hotels"".

The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was
immoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived
elsewhere.

Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her
citizens, who were leaving by the thousands.

Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as ""a soldier for aliyah"",
ended by calling for the creation of a new ""total Jew"", living in
Israel.

Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the
difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,
Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the
country's political situation.

He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital
source of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing
directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been
produced about the intifada.

Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,
emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.

Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the
Israeli political situation. He could no longer step into an
Israeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real ""flesh and blood
character"".

He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of
Israeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too
pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,
and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.

Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,
unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the
country they lived in, he said.

He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish
people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in
literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English
language.

 1) Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CB360T... Are 
there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a ""slip-in"" bulb replacement)?
 
 2) Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my ""not damn near bright enough""

picked up this cheapo ""Motorcycle battery and charging system tester""... 
Hook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on ""Very good charge""... Start 
the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's 
supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK, but it stays down at 
the same point as just the battery.
 
 My question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, 
how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be 
darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...
 
 Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they 
just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?
 
 Is there an easy fix for this?

13,"I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(
toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well 
because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got 
into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium 
would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.
But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 
supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).

Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams 
per day).

	1. Review Article ""Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney 
	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C"" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.
	   5(3):110-129(1985).

But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both 
glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this 
production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, 
but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.

	2. ""Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in 
	    patients with kidney stones"" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)
	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary 
	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.

	3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria"" Clin. Sci. 38
	   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day 
	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.

For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is 
required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for 
oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is 
quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  
The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% 
of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable 
and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 
6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic 
acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the 
extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a 
very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 
Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day 
increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg 
per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was 
increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose 
and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion 
before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average 
before supplementation.

B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There 
are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about 
yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the 
speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must 
have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then 
explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C 
challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your 
intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you 
take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient 
in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate 
kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets 
absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day 
showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309
-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase 
in urinary oxalate excretion.

	Here are the high oxalate foods:

	1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.
	   Contain at least 25mg/100grams

	2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, 
	   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.
	   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.

If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot 
of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points 
out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your 
intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being 
absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't 
have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for 
males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).
B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more 
per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  

The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day 
for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with 
this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 
requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that 
either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 
excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,
isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to 
supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that 
increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking 
birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the 
other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your 
dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone 
formation should be given B6 supplements.

One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your 
Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is 
calcium-oxalate.

	4. ""The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of 
patients with calcium oxalate calculi""Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)

	5. ""Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the 
crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium 
interaction""J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).

	6.Review Article, ""Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment 
of renal calcium stones"" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).

There are actually about three times as many articles published in the 
medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone 
formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in 
stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier 
post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I 
guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney 
stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought 
I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

*includes data and instruction {code} caches.  The 68030, 68LC040, & 68040 
have built-in caches for both.
**68000 Mac designs created a 4MB limit.
***The 040 has 2 clocks, an internal processor clock [PCLK] that is 2x freq of 
external bus clock [BCLK] which is the one used to rate the chips 
(Bradley Lamont; Motorola 68040 data book).  Some compilers produce programs 
sensitive to the PCLK and so they act as if the 68040 was a clock doubler 
chip, but this very compiler and program dependent.  Compliers maybe written 
to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040's PCLK in the 
future.  As it is now, studies such as one in a Byte article {which showed 
040/25 ~486/50 and roughly ~486dx2/50} are very dependent on the machine, OS, 
and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance.
*#Motorola claims (PC Week 09/07/92; 09/14/92).

As the PowerPCs are to be in both IBM and Mac machines I have listed them 
separately to eliminate redundancy.  They are Motorola CPU RISC chips.

CPUs Comparison List
As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the 
same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at 
higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th 
ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020 
and above.

<=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address 
lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it 
down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}

286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips 
come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The 
hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X. 
The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between 
the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the 
286 ~ 68020 comparison.}

386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0 
is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for 
apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the 
Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.  
The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them 
comparative to 386sxs.}

486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost 
solution for people who do not need the FPU.  Only with programs sensitive to  
PCLK & pipelining does the 68LC040 behave like 486dx2 - FPU or a '486dx2sx'.}

486     ~ 68040 {two 32-bit microprocessors with built-in FPU, MMU, 8K 
internal cache (which is implemented as two 4K caches in the 68040 and one in 
the 486).  Only with programs sensitive to PCLK & pipelining does the 68040 
behave like a 486dx2.}

Pentium   ~ 68060 {Both are planned to be superscalar but both have heat 
problems.  These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93; 
4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek 
12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium
(PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.} 

PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS, 
Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later 
Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in 
a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}

Hardware 
{In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you 
add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating 
systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software 
developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).}
Color Support/Display
 Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of 
32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw 
allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-
bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y 
independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 
dpi [12"" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including 
autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz 
vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser 
Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and 
IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit 
color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  
To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display 
capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit 
color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX 
will change this.
In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one 
monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same 
thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree 
of overlap of the pictures.
VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of 
 built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit
 color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. 
Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became 
 standard with the SE/30.

IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system 
interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing 
BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation
of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program 
interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer 
Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a 
standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is 
actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like 
Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, 
especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present 
things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver 
and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, 
and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with 
an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 
486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 
and still have ALL the colors one started out with}.
Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster 
processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD 
ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  
MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter
 original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.
CGA: Color Graphics Array
 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.
EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array
 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions 
 could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.
VGA:  Video Graphics Array*
 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are 
 the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a 
 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock
 (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals
 from EGA/CGA etc. 
MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*
 subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA 
 and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  
 Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.
SVGA:  Super VGA*
 This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch 
 all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer 
 using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating
 as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a 
 standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things
 are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution
 of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since 
 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, 
 some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually 
 at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital 
 Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], 
 some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting 
 factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: 
 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a 
 64K ""window"", etc.
Other non-SVGA standards: 
8514/a:
 IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions 
 like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations 
 from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do 
 not have interlacing. 
TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some
 do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.
XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array
 newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones 
 are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at 
 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.
XGA-2
 Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in
 Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area
 fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-
 exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be 
 far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth 
 isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other 
 companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh 
 rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual 
 discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.
*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.

Expansion
Both Mac & IBM
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software
 drivers.  ""Fast SCSI-1"" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode
 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully
 SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast
 SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  
 hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are
 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and
 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can
 use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such
 is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called ""fast SCSI-1"". 
 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics
 but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a
 different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which
 makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.
Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though 
 Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager
 needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI
 interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast 
 asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2
 controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) 
 though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port 
 interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus 
 Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some
 Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard 
 and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.
IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with 
 systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.
 Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers
 out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications
 which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.

Mac
Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin 
 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs
 could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity 
 feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx 
 used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new 
 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.
 The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every
 memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will
 not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.
 Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs 
 had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris 
 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that 
 allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same 
 size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting 
 in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).
Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.
Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. 
PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, 
 Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  
 Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: 
 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with
 the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in 
 IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows 
 through put down.
NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,
 and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:
 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and 
 Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a 
 Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet 
 to DMA.
NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:
 ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7"" instead of the 
 old 12"".
QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's 
 VLBus - ""Architecture is identical to that of VLBus"" (Byte 10/92:128).
 Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.
CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  
 Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at 
 the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to 
 dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each 
 NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with 
 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.

IBM
Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-
like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.

HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: 
MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited
 only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.
IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics 
 Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.
 currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives. Can have more than one hard drive. 
ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface
 ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in
 many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of
 hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. 

BUS interfaces
{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working 
with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}
ISA
 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a
 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).
 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,
 hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards
 aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}
 while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's
 showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit
 (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  
MCA {Micro Channel}
 IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; ""allows use of more than one CPU in a computer"" 
 (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components 
 involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA 
 and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).
EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}
 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to 
 self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable 
 interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.
VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}
 Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}
 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus 
 mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for 
 video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of
 their patents (Mel Martinez).
QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture
 (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines
 (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.
PCI
 Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace 
 ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.

OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]
and multiple application use.}
Mac
512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows 
Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, 
menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require 
clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires 
access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM 
chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support 
interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS 
has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and 
therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control 
over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with 
some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a 
totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon 
Wtte).
6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, 
 cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  
 Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program 
 interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of 
 AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a 
 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as 
 real RAM is below 8MB.
6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.
6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.
7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard 
 to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present 
 non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on
 system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking 
 within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing 
 can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be 
 accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, 
 Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable 
 IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType 
 support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present 
 machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is 
 both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit 
 mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last 
 'free' OS.
7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than 
 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode 
 on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. 
 Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades
 {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.
 [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system 
 fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any 
 RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all 
 fonts from the system file.]
A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and 
 a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS 
 is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac 
 ROMs.  Price: $709.
Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats 
including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and 
DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' 
and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most 
still play.

IBM
 Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for 
programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  
Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, 
what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  
This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or 
EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to 
better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which 
is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it 
reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware 
support is needed.
Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing 
all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing 
its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (""Undocumented Windows"") and 
""There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to 
abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present"" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 
#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC 
judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no 
action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of 
choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has 
turned down Microsoft's copyright of ""Windows"" which would allow it to charge 
a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).
MicroSoft OSes
DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier 
 with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program 
 must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS 
 Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit 
 Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in
 DOS 4.0.
DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk 
 defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for 
 networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} 
 (Byte April 1993:44-46).
DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).
Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to 
 deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to
 run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the
 equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].
 This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac
 programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and
 still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed
 is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).
 Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS
 counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).
Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base 
 requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. 
 Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).
Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  
 Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 
 with built-in peer to peer networking support.
Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the 
 swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in 
 the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the 
 reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM 
 but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).
 This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric 
 multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in
 networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even
 though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor
 is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993
 (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993
 (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495
 (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).
Other OSes
PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS 
 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).
DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} 
 and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later 
 version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple 
 file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).
OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,
 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, 
 multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file 
 to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. 
 IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this 
 (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).
AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.
NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final 
 version to be out by May 25, 1993.
Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric 
 multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with 
 tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and 
 communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users
 server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.
Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel 
 Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM 
 (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run 
 on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps 
 will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to 
 Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow 
 progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in 
 late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}

PowerPC
Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; 
MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA 
video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week 
3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.
Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and 
to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to 
sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser 
9/92:146)}
(MacWeek 3/22/93).
PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on
 PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain
 (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard
 drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.
 Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.
Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) 
 and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and 
 PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).
Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.
Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the
 Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state 
 that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details
NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.

OS Number Crunching (Mel Park)
Mac
 Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard 
Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an 
FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or 
taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are 
handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal 
representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment 
of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and 
the FPU programmed directly.

IBM
 Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when 
emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever 
compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers 
exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS 
prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this 
better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, 
Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.

Networking [Includes printing]
WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially 
if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.
Mac
Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  
LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for 
each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to 
include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in 
Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at 
about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and 
transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.
The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet 
interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a 
network option since 1989.
Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can 
use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS 
as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, 
Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing 
machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows 
typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version 
will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 
(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC 
Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software 
built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. 
Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in 
the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the 
chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.
Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.
 {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}

IBM  
Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.
Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk 
protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.
Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible 
with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to 
that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more 
forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, 
{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and 
offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more 
complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac 
finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  
InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)
Printing {Very OS dependent}
DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, 
 and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written 
 software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly 
 implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one 
 software program to the next.
Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing ""jobs"" 
 in the print queue, but it always lists printers as ""active""... even if they 
 are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers 
 on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine 
 which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like 
 and intelligent about this.
OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.
Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do 
not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and 
not that of the OS involved.

Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features 
than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars 
by both worlds.
The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware 
standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to 
handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac 
hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  
built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and 
NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent 
equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs 
which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.
 Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.
All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where 
noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card 
needed except for 24-bit color display}.
IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA 
monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1, 
sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to 
16-bit color, etc}.
Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz 
equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor.
LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160.
Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or 
~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a 
PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color.
Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50 
MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80}; 
$3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit 
color}

8,"I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
(read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, 
fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

This person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so I don't see weight as too much
of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go?
I want her to hold onto me  :-)   rather than the grab rail out back, and
I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional
signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???

I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that
she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...

Thanks,

8,"Yo, did anybody see this run of HARD COPY?

I guy on a 600 Katana got pulled over by the Police (I guess for
speeding or something).  But just as the cop was about to step
out of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia.
Ang then, the cop gives chase.

Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!!
Everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet
battle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who is
being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights)
slows a couple of times to taunt the cop.   After blowing a few stop
signs and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.

The Kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance
machine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse, we all know that cages,
especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our
high performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into the
Kat.

Luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  But
dude, how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah, we've all went out and played
cat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy can
you get!?!?!  It took just one look at a ZX-7 who tried this crap
to convince me not to try any shit like that.  (Although the dude
collided with a car head on at 140 mph, the Kawasaki team colors
still looked good!!!  Just a few scratches, like no front end....
3 inch long engine and other ""minor"" scratches...)

If you guys are out there, please, slow it down.  I not being
an advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that 
annoying ass noises...), but just think...  The next time you
punched it (whether you have an all mighty ZX-11 or a ""I can
do it"" 250 Ninja), just remember, a kid could step out at any   
time.

Peace & ride (kinda) safe.

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a ""character"" containing
all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.  This
means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
time slot, which basically indicates a BREAK.  There is no special way to
detect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there's no magic signal
generated by UARTs, etc."
12,"I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from
a MC146818A Real Time Clock.  Has anyone out there had some experience
in doing this?  The specs call for a few sequences to be met before
standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but
I thought that I had it worked out.  However, with a 32kHz crystal the
lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA.  This is
three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting
to create.

I have done the following things:

1) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup, and AS is
   low during this time.


2) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or
   WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted.

What am I doing wrong?

In Texas, it is legal to carry handguns while ""traveling"", and also to and from
sporting activities.           ^^^^^^^^

1,"Hi Steve,

As the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your
mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this
software - the quick answer is yes! The long answer is yes - but a
few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are
the same, you know! As far as ""many bugs"" go, it would probably be more
useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)

Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix
Sun Solaris so it is possible.

The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the
RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear
about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to
how to fix it.

As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would
bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the
few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients
only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see
anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't
see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!

One final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it.
If you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for
any money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism,
maybe that will get results??"

18,"Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy-
theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist 
support?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People 
are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the
eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People
begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children
and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.








Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale
of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his 
conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these
idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.




Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating
skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.

I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated 
political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the ""right"" things
(where ""right"" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)
is showing an acute case of ""myopic social perspective"", not to mention
arrogance and utter stupidity.

Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established
body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of
virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination
of local control over Affairs Public.  

Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated 
like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic 
people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the ""oughta-be's""
inside their own hopelessly closed minds.




OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific
incident.




Hmmm, ""Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion,
nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""  Liberal translation: ""the
federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local
school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays,
while prohibiting others.""

I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing
for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.

Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.



[Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted] 


Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you
may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it
primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences
of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of
conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk
resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their
good fortune?




This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America
that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People
and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh 
is the populist nemesis of that movement.

I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary
piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain ""venom""
at all, let alone ""venom"" comparable to an individual who callously murdered
millions out of racism.




A very serious tone in that oratory.




You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, 
BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather
than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention 
that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.
He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be
intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).
This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is
treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.

I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just
kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and
needed to be exterminated.




This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since
Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of
the Aryan as ""the highest image of the Lord"" fits with Christian doctrine.




Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than
publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-
Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent
to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching
just a wee bit here.




Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment
industry here.



Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate
government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show
to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the
depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control 
of Hollywood.

90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control 
of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an
early age the ""right"" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. 
Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the ""young heads full
of mush"" hyperbole indicates.




Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for
government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.




Indication here that ""Elements of the Media"" (since career is a self-selected
categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in
the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.
No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only
that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the
situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.

You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable 
opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his 
audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that 
purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree 
or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who 
is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?

Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would
oppose government control of the media.



        

It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.
Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people
who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology
on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?
Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that
they exist in your mind, not the real world.




Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve
Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading
laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.

As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.
Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend
of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism
in America through ""business/government partnership"" and increased levels
of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes
in grade school.




Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler
because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of
racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to
racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear 
racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal 
Left.

The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked
on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized
Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to 
that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear
to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush 
Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than 
the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would
have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on
homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one

correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.



Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask
about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.

Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs.

Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive
gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in,
would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from
someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one
problem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question.
Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to

Does that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns? I think not. You
are discounting guns purchased beforehand, and guns purchased for
purposes other than self-defense, which can also be used for defense.

Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the
#1 spot.

It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first
and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points
higher in both leagues than any other year.

Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.

Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin
Mitchell :->.

The other elite fielders in the league.

This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.
His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of
that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the
Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and
judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play
third.

Add another to the elite fielders list.

Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know
what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low
1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988
(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.

Strange last two years.

According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.
But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).

Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every
other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.

Last year -- a fluke or a portent?

Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close
to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?

Brook  is declining.

Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies
gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while
at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder
at third.

Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about
10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry
Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.

Moving back to second was a good idea.

So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total
of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.

Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,
HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break
the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.

Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.

Not a good fielder.

Both are better off at shortstop.

Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to
have helped his fielding any.  

Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest
DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean.

There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC
processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is 
not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to
swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications.
As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between
a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.

This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has

Then you must be living in an alternate universe. Where were they?

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,
documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.

The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.

Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.
Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.
Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,
its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States. 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan.

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR.

We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the 
neighboring lands.

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.

But what about the lives of seven million human beings?
If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?

All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous
appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

                KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the
Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of
thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. 

Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred
thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and
Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims
at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole
thing has now gone entirely too far.


They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 
78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this 
time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the 
plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.

of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.
     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and 
massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered
mountain passes.
     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani
reports of a massacre.

                         Scalping Reported
     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them 
from retrieving more bodies.
     ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aide
to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies,
they began firing at us.""

                         Truckloads of Bodies
     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,
Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani
bodies.
     ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as
many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many had
been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a
definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly
and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition
is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids
mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous


Unless one classifies ""thinking and informal exploration"" as a
mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would
consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as
unscientific.  


Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not
clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be
taken as describing what ""science is mainly about.""  Consider,
for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking
a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and
what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what
invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and
still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,
that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that
some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are
ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the
definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are
""mainly about.""

The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient
context for people to understand my proposed definition.


I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only
take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians
that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  

As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about
""absolute scientific truth.""  I think it is more useful to talk
about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the
kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have
proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of
degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the
relevance of different kinds of evidence.  

One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as
psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion
regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,
the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the
historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence
are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to
speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that
speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to
identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence
was presently available for them, and to describe how research
could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to
uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper
of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the
author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It
is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)


I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --
deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When
proponents of some practice see no value in more careful
investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many
researchers' minds.  

This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some
intersection between things that are worth investigating and
things that are advocated by those who seem careless or
unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can
understand why many scientists would just as soon select other
directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one
wants to become this generation's Rhine.


I think this is absurd.  


I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,
dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are
submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for
publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly
eases one's defense.)

Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either
on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little
about either and so have nothing to offer."

Let me see if I have this straight --- if a person knows S1 and S2,
and the serial number of the unit, it's easy to reconstruct UK.
Of course, if they know SK, the ""family key"", they can easily get the
serial number of any unit that has made a transmission.  So with S1 and
S2 being used for a while ""batch"" of the unit keys, the number of
used S1/S2 pairs will probably be fairly low.  Of course, you have to
believe that the NSA/FBI/name-your-favorite-government agency will
know SK so all it needs is the S1/S2 pairs, and presto, nasty details 
like court orders for wire taps are no longer necessary.

Now, I'm not one of the people who distrusts the government at every

If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong,
then I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means. Where does
the authority for a belief come from? Nowhere, for a belief is itself
authoratative. If I produce authority for a belief, where will I find
authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. In short, 
the mind has to start somewhere. (By the way, the majority of Christians,
i.e. Catholics, believe in the authority of the Church, and derive the
authority of the Bible from its acceptance by the Church.)"

Hello WinNetters:

I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of 
MS Access and Borland Paradox/Win.  However, are there any users out there 
with experience with the database package called ""Approach"".  It has gotten
a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it
would require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access
because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a
field to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it
seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz,
6 MB ram).

So, please provide me with your thoughts are ""Approach"", good and bad.  Thanks.

17,"DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]


          Born 1972
          Attended 9th Grade
          Middle School No. 17

          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25
          Microdistrict No. 3
          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]

Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came 
home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period 
in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was 
the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and 
other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first 
cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and 
on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring 
that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.

When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped 
by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. 
The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus
begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to 
the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking 
passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not 
taken for Armenians.

We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old 
building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was 
packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th 
Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking
passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.
Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning
cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""Death to
the Armenians"" was written on the cars.

When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still
quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call 
Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. 
Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to 
come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us
to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you 
enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was 
beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, 
that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people 
were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very 
long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, 
looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said 
things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a
car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that 
they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that 
there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of 
the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later 
found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri
Avakian was killed, too.

When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go 
home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We 
started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We
tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We
decided she had already left.

We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my
father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's
work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our
town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get
out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,
but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the
call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke
down the door and came into the apartment . . .

They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians 
were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we 
could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He 
read the surname ""Danielian,"" turned the page, read ""Armenian,"" and that alone
was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the 
courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, 
pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" They 
had knives and steel truncheons.

I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if
I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents 
and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded
that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken 
outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to
push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind 
her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began 
beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.

We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their 
balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they 
strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I 
lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the
first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are
lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from 
their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is 
broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an 
ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.

We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and 
try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, 
they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our 
neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she
sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the 
window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a 
result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken 
away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken 
away, and everything will be OK.

But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the
ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received
attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 
o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with 
some ""assistants."" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, 
and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds
on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are 
in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.

In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them
Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only
Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,
before the 27th.

Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was 
released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first 
they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out 
that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.

My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My 
mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the 
leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.

They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their
heads were smashed open and bled profusely.

At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out 
later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called 
specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address 
and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.
Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the 
phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He 
denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father 
answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he 
called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of 
automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had 
never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 
years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he 
was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.

My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was 
two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to
go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He
went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural 
projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and 
later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from 
the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in 
a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.


My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I
always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it
was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and
wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military
School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-
sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join 
the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life
long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it
more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,
and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.

Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home 
of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.

While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had
suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at
their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long
time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I
also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped

. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,
about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with
his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and
his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even
came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But
in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of
others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .

Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,
was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to 
recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.
I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision
of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of 
Armenia.

After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give
Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live
peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they
can do that.

I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.
After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I 
think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.

You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno
Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had 
even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move 
here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and 
that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was
wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct 
a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies 
in the hands of our government.

Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US 
has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada 
from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion 
of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  
Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess 
we ""invaded"" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have 
invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles 
for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from 
Spain.

So if you mean by the word ""invaded"" some sort of military action where
we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally
""invaded"" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.
(If some nation ""invades"" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be
invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of
view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).

No, it's someone who believes in ""peace-at-all-costs"".  In other words,
a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and
Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one
who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political 
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.

""Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,"" you ask?  Well, it depends
on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over
freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you
than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's ""bad"" to be a peace-nik.

The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are
not like them to be ""bad"" and ""unconscionable"".  I would not have any
argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and
stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with 
the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to
legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and 
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank
hypocrisy!)  All to stop we ""warmongers"" who are willing to stand up 
and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do
so requires a strong national defense.

Time to get off the soapbox now.  :)

Yes, worshipping Jesus as the super-saver is indeed hero-worshipping

into how to change the world, he wasn't a communist God, but he was

Without getting into the *really* *thorny* questions about reverse
engineering and all of that, let me just point out that there already
exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse
which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming --
this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device
(again, ignoring the reverse engineering questions).  Speaking from
experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some
six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were
all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses.
Made me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-)

So on this point at least there's not so much worry.

But whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is
really secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself
likely to be secure, methinks."

I understand, believe it or not, and there are any number of kinds of 
conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider 
using this scheme for.  On the other hand, I don't see ""Clipper"" as providing 
a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why 
I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious 
security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.

There is still plenty of market for real crypto.


They cost an arm and a leg, though. ""Clipper"" is obviously aimed at the mass 
market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.


This is old news.  I can do this now.


There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a 
large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even 
simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department 
of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to 
compete in international information systems markets.

Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in 
the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be 
the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to 
hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in 
confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to 
order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I 
want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on 
electronically.

This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on 
crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.

Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe, 
all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put 
more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is ""good enough for 
anyone who has nothing to hide.""  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just 
as much as ""no one needs an assault rifle"".

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.
That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the
only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who
witnesses a crime can do so.

Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a
description of the car and the license number, and tell them the
specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
(ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill
out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any
ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to
appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight

      Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to
get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question
quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.


      In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed
to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.


       Most states do not require the registration of cars that are
not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do
so for tax purposes more than anything else.
    

       Many states do not currently require this, and most, again,
only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused 
is not required to have insurance.


       The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are
significant difference between making rules for *use on public property*
and *making rules for ownership*.

       The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this
have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and
have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are
never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for
a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York,
Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun
owners would, in theory, support these planes.  (Although the
numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem, that
intentional misuse is).  They've simply seen it abused and are leery of
the next person who comes down the pike with a ""reasonable"" suggestion
they've already seen abused.

miscalculated the license renewal by $300 and that I need to send
in a check to ""avoid further delay"" in the processing of my registration.
The thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so
I ignored it.  I received another letter and then the phone calls
started coming.  First from the finance guy and then from the general
manager, both hounding me for the extra money.  They left me alone
once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause
in the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL.
Afterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another
$300 off after the deal had been signed, right?  I told them not 
to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future.
They didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a
used Ford at a Toyota dealership.

For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so

For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,

Game Summary:

Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that
woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!

The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have
been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the
first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday
when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that
he was getting bored back there...

Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After
Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards
to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead
to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed
the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and
in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his
stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the
right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and
Garry should turn down their assists :-).

The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong
and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive
struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when
Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into
the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not
a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got
a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.

Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to
give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league
didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a
good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards
the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept
missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give
the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the
fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots
were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.

Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was
disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered
a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the
season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was
Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed
Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do
it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for
next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the
end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.
He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title
the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based
on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.

He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it ""outstanding""). Happy with
the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux
of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.
Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there
was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in
four years if there was a consensus.

The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May
took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble
getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving
throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres
blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed
across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the
top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling
through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the
race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.

Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line
and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was
all over it.

The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.
Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when
Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer
took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't
get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the
FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and
headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to
make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top
of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John
Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.

But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to
just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all
over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through
Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that
missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as
he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.
Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried
about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right
next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and
mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the
puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his
stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks
end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.

Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking
minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get
set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued
to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.
Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill
allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a
faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of
him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and
that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,
7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.

The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long
they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to
Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by
Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of
the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had
moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving
at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net
at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to
put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.

The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek
was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the
neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS
blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the
left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at
18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between
the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off
angles...

That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.

Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the
FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in
the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until
he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he
hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.

Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood
untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under
Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,
horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange
reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they
could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade
that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria
for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...

Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS
could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,
but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck
from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across
to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net
just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,
but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing
puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.

But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive
left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate
out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew
in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at
5:24 to tie the game at 4.

Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up
in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in
the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the
line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.

Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.
The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went
after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated
to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing
through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over
the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season
for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th
of the season.

Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres
power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the
chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.

Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to
make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running 
out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.
Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left
corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found
Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the
right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton
chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48
on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,
and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the
game.

So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much
in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night
(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).
The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against
with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals
despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place
since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.

A couple misc notes:

Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to
announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.

In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,
but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.

The Times of Trenton has reported that ""a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma""
has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no
further tests are necessary in the near future.

Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he
expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,
he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a
role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would
ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this
was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being
likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either
confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the
chain inside SGI was misleading them.


There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came
out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The
chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was
a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and
age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the
hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our
minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost
from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in
the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over
its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.


Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support
or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks
to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there
will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,
but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you
are referring to).

Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,
but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result
in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into
systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*
you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)


They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly
they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions
may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the
industry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we
won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we
don't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).


But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year
period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year
period?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience
(with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available,
yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!


I missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your
frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might
have an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't
going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we 
hear similar things from more than one person/site).

All of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI's."

This is why I asked to be 'enlightened'.  You are making claims about what

Okay scarasm does deserve sacrasm, but I already contact my local officals, my
congress rep., senators, Watch evening news, news programs, and C-SPAN.
  


The fact is that Primetime (TM of ABC) has had numberous reposts on such waste
programs that already exist.  Again, if we are truely intrested in eliminating
the DEBT, we must REMOVE the DEFICIT, and do away with ALL PORK !!!  

There have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs 
from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed
that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by 
changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).

True, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.  

Clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class
to pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not 
specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.

IMHO this whole discussion named ""Motif looks like MS-Windogs"" is totally
stupid. The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window
Manager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat
similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is.
But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work
without each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason,
he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif,
which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit
is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and
features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.

You cannot say ""A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer"" ONLY because they have the
wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete
different worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel
at the same position as MS-W.

I'm sure it is, and I am not amused.  Every time I read that part of the
TIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the
complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their ""arbitrary but
carefully chosen number"" is neither.  Additionally, I find their
choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why
not just use the letters ""TIFF""?

     TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The 
satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section 
housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof 
mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The 
proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation 
pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered 
around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.

     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 
2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a 
single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be 
powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

     Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in ""Spacecraft Design 
Innovations in the APL Space Department,"" Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, 
Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992)."

   So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you, Master of Wsidom, 
							       ^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you insist on giving me names/titles I did not ask for you could at
least spell them correctly. /sigh.

   when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that 
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE, 
   and hence ALL their actions, their courts, their laws are illegitimate on 
   the ground of occupied territories.

No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I'm merely asking you whether the existance
of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right
to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the 
question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have 
not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.

   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my
   point in the post, that you ""responded to"". The point is that since Israel 
   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights 
   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic 
   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.

If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then 
tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?

   |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others

   |> Such as the right to live? That's nice. The swedish government is a group

   Do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here ?

Worthy or not, I was just applying your logic to a related problem.
Am I to assume you admit it wouldn't hold?

   |> |> What kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue?

   ok, Master of Wisdom is throwing up. 
   You people stay away from the screen while he is doing it !

Oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone?
I'll let you in on a secret... It's not for real.. Take my word for it.

   |> |> It seems that the US law -represented by US State dept in this case-
   |> |> is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories.
   |> |> Anyway, as for Hamas, then obviously they turned to the islamic system.

   |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?

   The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because
   any system can solve it. 
   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). 

I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for 
all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that

reply.

   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) 
   said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:
	   ""Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal
						^^^                  ^^^
	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.
	   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of
	   the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than
	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to
	   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be 
	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to
	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.""

Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd
be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to 
a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he
wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will
make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to 
make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get 
something back.


   ""We"" and ""our"" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). 

   Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the 
   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !

   I think that is fair enough .

No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve 
the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.
Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land.

The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored

more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to
do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they
must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.

With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed

in fact considered by many to be the 'experts'.  I am not sure where OBs

These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It
really angers me that you insisted you were right, and that you had
no clue what your own car weighed. Why didn't you check when I first
told you that your figures were implausible?



I'd like to hear a better explanatin of how you come to that 
conclusion from the above data.

No, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in
8.1 according to C+D. Interestingly, the Stealth ES, which is
*faster* than your RT does the samerun in 8.5 seconds according to
C+D. Kind of embarassing isn't it? Why didn't you check the figures

before posting? It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out
twice with *your own* figures.


You really should have checked.

      *2*
If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?

Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn
will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your
222hp sports car is so easily beaten. 

A Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers),
has less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive,
just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp
went to, its a mystery to me.

Pardon me Tim, but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail
to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which
killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and 
whereabouts of all of them. Several villages were shelled. How could the IDF
possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted
villages? You see, it was an arbitrary act of ""retaliation"".



The problem, Tim, is that the original reason for the invasion was Palestinian
attacks on Israel, NOT Lebanese attacks. 


First, I believe that my statement applies to both sides.

Having said that, I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately
negotiable and what is not. For example, no country has the right to abuse
one's human rights. Deciding whether there will be one or two states in
Palestine is a legitimate question. While de facto one state exists, Israel 
must treat all within its domain equitably.


Yes, I am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify
occupying your neighbor's land. Israel must resolve its disputes with the
native Palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks.


Not true. Lebanese were not attacking Israel in the 1970s. With a strong
Lebanese government (free from Syrian and Israeli interference) I believe
that the border could be adequately patrolled. The Palestinian heavy
weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a
threat as once existed."

We all know about power and corruption. But we all know that abuse is

In mentioning some nonsense about psychology :) and atheism, Bob Muir asks
the following question.   


I answer in the affirmative.  Now this answer might sound a little
intellectually dishonest to Bob, but I think I have been accused before
of that heinous crime and am man enough to take it.  !-)  What thinking
person has not at one time or other been accused of it?   Is it
politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group
permitted the luxury of arrogance?   

Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting
atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  I have a 
difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something
about the subject.     

Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says 
he will need to be proven wrong about it.  Well, I don't even waste 
my time trying.  I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it. 
In response, he tells me he will say an ""atheist's prayer"" for me. 

Good luck, Bob.  And, best regards.

*** THIS IS LONG ***

I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and
a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).  I have been running
Mathcad 3.1, under Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5MB RAM drive,
2MB/1MB Smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) for
several months.

I am interested in the faster Mathcad 4.0, but I am concerned about reported
swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft's claim about increased
speed.

TO 386SX USERS:

  Will Mathcad 4.0 run without a swap file, or insist that I use a swap file?

So far, in response to a less detailed description of my setup, or in
unrelated postings, the more informed answers, on the net or by E-mail,
appear to be:

  1) by fuess@llnl.gov (David A. Fuess) >>

   >> According to Mathsoft, no. Mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as
   >> not to overburden the physical resources. They say this is actually a

   >>
   >> I gave Windows a small temporary swapfile (I'm leery of files that must
   >> remain in fixed locations on my hard disk), and all seems well.

* So it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on Mathsoft's  *

they want to wait for ISDN (that we should be so lucky...).  Feeding
pre-encrypted data into the compressor will cause it to chuckle at
you; you'd have to tap into the guts of the phone and hack either
the compressed data stream, or selected parts of the output stream

way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new
car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by
most salespeople I met.

Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where
I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales
support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what
I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the
dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on
what he's seen and heard from his customers. 

Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, 
fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or
so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more
like $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any
warranty work, without counting against the refund."

While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a ""good thing"" by posting
that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they
will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I
have seen the film called ""The Gay Agenda"" and along with my church we found
it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of
editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia
familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people
are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither
you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as
many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life
I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something
obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are
innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an
abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not
support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian
Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants
your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed
homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that
there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.
I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.

The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-
istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.

THE FOUNDER OF AN ""EX-GAY"" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO

by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)

In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa
awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE
INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians ""a way out of the homosexual death-style""
through prayer.  ""I'd like to give the award back,"" Caligiuri now laughs, ""I'm
no longer deserve it.""
  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national ""ex-gay"" movement peaked
with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well
as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-
gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  ""There's no reality
in it,"" he says, ""I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.""
  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the
organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again
Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who
are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  ""We offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,"" explains Bob Davies, director of
Exodus.  He ventures that ""about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-
sexuality are men.""
  ""Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time,"" says Lisa Seeley, a former ""redeemed lesbian"" who worked with
Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  ""These
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.""
  ""It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,"" says sex educator
Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. ""But it's really impossible to
change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,
but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.""
  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all
hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar.  ""I was really drunk,"" he recalls, ""and I
went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all
night, and the next morning he raped me again.""
  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the
home he shared with his ex-lover.  ""He had another man there with him,""
Caligiuri recalls.  ""I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is
about, I don't want to be this way anymore.""
  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery
with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's
gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its
first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,
Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell.
  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  ""We were listed
under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,"" Caligiuri says, ""so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out
where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-
sexuality.""  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,
adding, ""They'll do anything to reach these people.""
  ""David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,"" recalls Peter
Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, ""like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.""
  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  ""They were relieved,"" he recalls.
""They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better
that I should be a 'reformed' gay person.""
  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  ""By the time I appeared on Sally's
show,"" ""I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their
father.  I was horny all the time.""
  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he ""used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs.""  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping
with other ""reformed"" homosexuals.
  ""I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex
with one another,"" Caligiuri says.  ""We'd go to conferences in other cities,
and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody
else.""
  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,
Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's
host asked him if he ever ""acted on temptation,"" his answer was a lie.
  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating
yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  ""I was too sick
to go to church,"" he explains.  ""The more time I spent away from those people
the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.""
  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry's doors.  ""I'd convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for ex-gay people,"" he says.
  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (""I'm interest-
ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.""), considering romance (""But
not with a CHristian!""), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.
""I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,"" he says.  ""I want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I
may have brought to our community.""

---end article---

Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th
similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have
come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,
like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian ""Lazarus Project"" of West
Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as ""Love In
Action"" and others, who either once claimed to have been ""reformed"" or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed
in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of ""sealing"" their
new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses
and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous ""sin""
through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-
cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also
mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain
functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-
place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's
_""Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and
self-acceptance."

You must be a new Armenian clown. You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF 
crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in 
such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has 
already been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer 
and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible 
for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian 
and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government 
as merely a step on the road to said genocide.

Receiving this message, I checked the reference, L.Kuper,""Genocide..."" and
what I have found was totally consistent with what Davidian said.The book
was like ""voice of Armenian revolutionists"" and although I read the whole book,
I could not find the original quota.
But there was one more thing to check:The original posting of Mutlu.I found 
the original article of Mutlu.It is as follows:



     ======================================================================
    ======

QUATO IS THE SAME, REFERENCE IS DIFFERENT !

DAVIDIAN LIED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME HE CHANGED THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF MUTLU
JUST TO ACCUSE HIM TO BE A LIAR.

Davidian, thank you for writing the page number correctly...

You are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow
you can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided
not to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise

n>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!
 
 o boy!   
 
 Please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not 
 like them!!!...because they really exist...why?
 
 As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source 
 given by Serdar Argic .. 
  
 You couldn't reject it...
 
 
 Here we go again..
 In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give 
 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc. 
 
[...]
 
 
 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
              
     
 
 
 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and 
those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

Not a chance.

#Am I making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals?  Where do they come 
#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from
#whatever is societally mandated.

It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily
very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what
is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little
over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different
thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),
but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating
meat may be perfectly legal.

#
#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality
#>#
#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.
#>#
#>#1)Who is society
#
#>Depends on the society.
#
#Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?

No.  Often the answer is ""we are"".  But if society is those who make
the rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should
make the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either,
but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things
about the US system, at least in principle.

#
#>#2)How do ""they"" define what is acceptable?
#
#>Depends.
#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).

Well, ideally they don't, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.
#
#>#3)How do we keep from a ""whatever is legal is what is ""moral"" ""position?
#
#>By adopting a default position that people's moral decisions
#>are none of society's business,
#
#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?

Because sometimes that's necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when
it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.

# and only interfering when it's truly
#>necessary.
#
#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?

IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various
kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive 
the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of
liar's paradox: ""force is necessary for freedom"".   One possible justification
is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if
their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if
we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.
#
#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem
#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem
#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.
#
#They see the need for a ""justice"" system.  How can we even define that term?

Only by consensus, I guess.

#  Thus you
#>get a situation where ""The law often allows what honour forbids"", which I've
#>come to believe is as it should be.  
#
#I admit I don't understand that statement.

What I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may
also be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don't let yourself
do it.  Eating meat, for example."

this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-(
I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)...

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric

In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,

	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.

Ok. I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However,
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it.

As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they
are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same
for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of ""negotiations"" in Madrid,
and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to
loose ?

Arabs feel that the current ""negotiations"" is ONLY for legitimizing the current
status-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and
""oranges"". That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked.

I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can
squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a
sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )

This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run
speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only
will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us
run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by
getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the
administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.

Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol
for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to
inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our
workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised,
we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to
catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during
silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end
because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)

As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as
I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone.
It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :)
(whether encrypted or not)

You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious,
why doesn't it exist already?  I've only seen netphone for Suns and
it didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections."

Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is
objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question.
It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--
realizing the risks--is to blame.


Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing
any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally
from the rest of society because of this.


And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent
person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,
many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment
of innocents.


But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals
on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.


Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do
so much to prevent false witnesses.


Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not
all such ""murders"" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life
is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?


But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an
innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of
society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder
include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an
execution, is it?


Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing
it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the
innocent victim is.


Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction
was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth
matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That
is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.


But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the
conviction was unfair.


Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all
possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our
flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,
but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if
we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.


But what we know has no effect on an objective system.


Why are you so sure?


Why is *your* reality important?


But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.
And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a
totally ideal and objective system.


Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.
We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to
the ideal system as possible.


Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.


We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep
separating the justice system from the pack?


I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an
objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective
system is not possible in practice."

3,"Hi!

I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5"" drive 
(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable 
from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.
The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives.

I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and
restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on
during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.
I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems
to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I 
try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive.

Can anyone offer any suggestions?
I'm in desperate need of help!!!

Thank you for your time."

There are several ways in which one can choose to intrepret any

   (a) Original intent
   (b) Subjectively intrepreted accordiong to political whims of the day.

If we use original intent as the basis for intrepreting the constitution, 
it is clear that the founding fathers intended that the individual citizen 
be allowed to bear arms similar to those used by soldiers of the day.

Right.  We'll probably end up giving them weapons.


During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite
German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides
sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of
weapon they wanted into Bosnia.

I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law
forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third
parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active
role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in
the outcome of the war.


Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's
about all we have to go on, isn't it?  

And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.  There are many levels
at which people react to what they see.  At the most fundamental level, you
do not have to consciously recognize the racial element - you simply tend to
empathize more with people who are like yourself.  As far preferring
Christian over Moslem, I am an atheist myself, and I think you'll agree that
in the US, the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of
religion, nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.

I can't tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not, but to be honest, many
automobiles are worth far more to their owners (in $$ value and $$ investment)
than the people that would take them.  I don't have figures on average property
tax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferior
public schools, jails, or the like, but I have a feeling that the amount the
government steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is 
significantly less than the value of many automobiles.  And for those who will
argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to
mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot
be valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that they
are not human beings.  Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track.  And 
Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions
of a single criminal.  I couldn't agree more.  One could trace any crime back
to the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out,
from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't
their fault?  Where does one draw the line?

3,"It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis
joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my
hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than
a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability
to adjust the tension of the stick.

I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and
no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. 
I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works
quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so
leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear
and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or
down in features.

For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here
compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra
$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.

Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something
that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle
Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,
down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into
a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on
PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.
(ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow)
Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when
compared to IDE?


I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.


IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's
how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be
an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different
platforms.

Is there any argument that 
IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the
drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able
to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because
of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?


If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to
perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main
memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE
can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored
in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives 
at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the
same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?


A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245
million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets
close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few
hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?


So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,
considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or
tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and
run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives
at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years
ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that
prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.


But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you
get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have
a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI
choice really give them more performance than IDE?


True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option
is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.


No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the
best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer
eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single
hard drive system?


With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that
PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, 
is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/
partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?


So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this
really a problem?  


After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,
I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor
have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or
to/from the same drive.


That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that
there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the
""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper court or other legal
          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
(""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.

Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?

A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a
     false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper
     Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton

Do you mean Juan Berenguer?  He was traded for Mark Davis in the middle
of last season.  Exchanged one stiff for another, as Berenguer hadn't
come back from his injury in 91.  I think he's retired now.

Anyhow, as middle relief, Marvin ain't that bad.  He at least can
pitch a couple of innings or do mop-up work.  I don't know much
about McMichael (was he the Mexican League guy?), but
everybody else in the pen is a 1 inning man, except maybe
Mercker.

#2	ROB ZETTLER		Season:	4th
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		C/C-

Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still
wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works
hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an
offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed
to make the team next year.

#3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, free agent from New Jersey
Grade:		C/C-

IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,
playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and
good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that
'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he
was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last
year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.

#4	JAYSON MORE		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft
Grade:		B+

After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp
before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not
particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,
proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most
reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.
Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73
games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.

#5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season: 4th
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B-

Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,
partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed
even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;
that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if
he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.

#6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft
Grade:		I (A)

At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),
Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury
in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),
but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),
which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from
their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still
susceptible to so-called ""rookie mistakes,"" but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back
from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.

#19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B

Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks
to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).
He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the
team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to
become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents."

I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.
I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
""storys"" about them. OK ?
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:
   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.
         It has an hightech ""boiler"" but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-
         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
         a chapter about the ""CARNOT-process"" which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an
         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the 
         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to
         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and ""cold""
         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of
         energy that carnot will give them.
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !
         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,
         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment !
         
   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-
         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with
         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the
         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.
         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures
         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. 

   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever
         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the
         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem
         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have
         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and
         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.

8,"Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,
the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, 
became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I
took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.
They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours
before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --
surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.

Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,
50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat
Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.
Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one
MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on
the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that
Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like
a big moto party.

After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,
and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/
pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the
parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from 
the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else
into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the 
ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of
the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a
bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.

Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could 
think was ""big"".  Then I put one foot up.  ""Heavy"" came to mind very
quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to 
tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed
nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.

By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even
on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that 
did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is
on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north
of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95
splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access
highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, 
Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.
On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about
30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many
thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.

Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along
in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane 
changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this 
thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the
fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was
non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.
Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,
but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless
buzz.

The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the
brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,
decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  
The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok
in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack
oft featured in ""Spencer for Hire"" -- a place where you could really 
find ""Spencer"", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting
through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.

About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal
for ""hold on tight"".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second
gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a 
short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light
traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.
Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort
lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went 
until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed
there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, 
I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.

Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the ""get
off in a mile"" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted
to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were
several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the 
slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could 
see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed
to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad
out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put
the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side
stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.


My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,
hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than 
list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is."

So antihistamines can cause weight gain.  NOW they tell me. :-)
Is there any way to find out which do & which don't?  My doctor
obviously is asleep at the wheel.

The original poster mentioned fatigue.  I had that too, but it was
mostly due to the really bizarre dreams I was having -- I wasn't getting

  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been
  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most
  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the 
  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area
  of jobs creation.

  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,
  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed
  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting
  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.

  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.
  ""It's the guns"" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other
  ""gun-nuts"" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the
  economy out of the recession.  ""Their buying them five times faster than
  ever before, and stockpiling left and right"", the Vice President said.  

  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have
  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several
  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have
  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.

  ""We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people"", said
  the President of Colt industries.  ""As long as Clinton is in office, we
  suspect it will"", he added.

  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new
  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's 
  called the ""Ban-One-A-Month"" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,
  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index 
  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw
  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any
  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the
  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.

  The President said, ""This law will benefit America two ways.  When the
  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run
  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,
  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the
  street.""  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee
  this program, citing her ""Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject
  of gun control"".

  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an
  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing
  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  ""Their stockpiling,
  stockpiling, stockpiling"" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference
  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.

  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment
  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been
  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, ""First we'll
  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning"", during a press
  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate
  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow
  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require
  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,
  after all of the cards have been drawn.

  The head of the BATF responded by saying, ""We will have to see if this
  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those
  guns"".

  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado
  declared this proposed law as being ""reasonable gun control which won't
  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns"".

	Well here is my $0.02 worth.  Advice from a grad student.

	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.
The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and 
learn as much as possible about it.  

	In my five years of education in this field, though brief 
compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of 
question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into
Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or
CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant.  
 
	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one 
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything
is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a 
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.

	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to 
learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your 
persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before her/his
sophamore year.                  

	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you 
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which 
case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.

Oh, *really*???


I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware
that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees
were listed seperately on my pay stub.

While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks
in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ...
A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our
major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president
Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers,
and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in
the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance
to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones
before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had
shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private
system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are
considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of
traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian""
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these).

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used
in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in
a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a
lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic
health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does
allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on
the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of
room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as


Please explain this one, hopefully in a way that Canadian readers

Paris, 22 April 1993

Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of
their experiments

""Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not
be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided
a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s"". This
summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300
participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in
Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by
the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for
the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).

OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :
-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of
       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small
       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested
       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,
       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few
       examples.

-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services
       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-
       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over
       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.

-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS
       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,
       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and
       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.

When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the
world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other
satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four
different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.

OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some
of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is
given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or
services; over the past four years some 200 companies and
organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over
100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning
organisation.



As the new technologies and services tested by these
OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then
make use of operational satellites such as those of
EUTELSAT."

True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos
the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from
the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially
after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It
seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war,
that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like
they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was ""nice and clean"" (smart
missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,
dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!


[ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]
                            ^^^^^^^^^

I should have said here ""militarily justified"".  It seems from your
comments below that you understood this as meaning ""morally justified"".
I apologize.


I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb
should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good,
inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back
for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.

Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan
was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,
the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's
ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.


I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made
which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the 
circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the
suffering caused by those decisions.  

[...]


Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US
and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other
back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't
care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured
in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to
Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion
by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil 
interests, caused us to take action.


[...]

I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the
war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep
Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.

Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler
would lead their nation to.


They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?
The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many
innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,
but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.

[...]

Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each
and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor
are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or
some other places.

Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not
agree with the present US policy of ""sucking up to them"" as you put it.
I agree that it is deplorable.


Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale
where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed
unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue
is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but
it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize
the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial 
prejudice thrown around.


No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks
on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.


Germans, perhaps.  ""Peers"" doesn't mean ""those who do the same thing"",
like having murderers judge murderers.  It means ""having people from
the same station in life"", presumably because they are in a better
position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).


OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*
logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.

The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing
liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give
a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative
sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)

BTW, I never used the word ""conspiracy"".  I don't accept (without *far*
more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal
conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.


Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people
if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and
there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then
innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say
it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.


I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain
and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That
conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.
And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't
mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as
being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of
an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed
necessary enough to go ahead with it.

But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I
don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult
decision under difficult circumstances.


You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.
I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.


Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to
those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply
refuse to condemn them for their decision.

One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;
even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of
that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the
same claim.


And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was
because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being 
""so deplorable"".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a
decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,
precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big
stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted
*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians
(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing
in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some
civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than
any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives
with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories
of ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.
Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years
and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But 
we are expected to swallow that ""hundreds of thousands"" of 
*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with 
the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  
What hogwash.  If ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi civilians died, 
it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to 
the Allied bombing.

Bad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for Apple
Macintosh PowerBook Duos) 
MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.

COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993

By Raines Cohen

     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook
Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss
and other problems.

     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week
issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM
products from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.
Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.

     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called
selfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But
Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with
nonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to
wake from sleep.

     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part
number stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips
instead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may
not tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses
nonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed
while the Duo sleeps.

     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo
cards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology
Works said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are
certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.

     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers
Duo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is
compatible with the slower chips.

     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that
some third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner
of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally
when in a Duo Dock."

as I understand the proposal. I could be wrong, but I've seen no

As the EFF noted, this raises further issues about the fruits of one
bust leading to incrimination in other areas.

But is it any worse than the current unsecure system? It becomes much
worse, of course, if the government then uses this ""Clinton Clipper""
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main
concern of most of us, I think. The camel's nose in the tent, etc.)

And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is
increased, thus allowing greater access to ""central office"" records by
the government (the conversations being encrypted, who will object to
letting the government have access to them, perhaps even automatically
archiving large fractions...). This was one of the main objections to
the S.266 proposal, that it would force telecom suppliers to provide
easy access for the government.

One the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted
conversations, now all it takes is one misstep, one violation that
gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt *all* of them!

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to
read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.

Here is a simplified way of looking at it:
The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The
second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still
exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal'
drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all
data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last
directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not

of a case where religion is not helping, instead it is used as a weapon

Wrong on both accounts.


No one is a ""rioter"" until they participate in a ""riot"", which is 
unlikely to happen, now.

Most of the *people* in L.A. are likely to have gotten up early to 
listen to the court announcement.


Sorry to disappoint you, but this seems unlikely.


I don't think he was told.
However, his statement was still appropriate.


Jury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously.  It is not meant 
to be a source of pride or instant fame.


Well, the many *people* who got up early to go to the court to hear 
the verdict found that justice was served.  Given your dire and 
cynical predictions, I imagine that it is you who will be surprised.  :-)

10,"As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon,
dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected
to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least
five posts! The Flames best line was probably
Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary
Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored
by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made
some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially
impressive. 

The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and
never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,
hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren
Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed
to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think
Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,
as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King
inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's
game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no
idea how serious - he didn't return.

I still think the Flames should win this series, but they better
buckle down."

Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside,
outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In
this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point
of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,
then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which
may make you headache.

The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and
all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the
successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then
it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.

My experience tells the second method is relible.

Hope this helps."

I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power
transformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if
anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.

I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power
transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something
I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other
words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be
real difficult at 15 KHz).

4,"Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This
is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the
stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI 
accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,
New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.

I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive
tower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto
which I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally
terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems
occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two
internal hard drives."

The STANDARD AT bus (ISA) runs at 8MHz, not 12.5 MHz, but some 
non-stnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since 
some boards don't work with faster than standard rates.  For instance, my 
486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.

The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  

33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus 
operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.

[Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs. IDE question...]

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great!

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?
Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.
Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI-2?

Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions."

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be
loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com
will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.


mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it.
The working of both drivers is totally the same.

When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,
because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the
ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone,
because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

Might anyone be able to point me to references to such
circuits?  I have seen simple amplifier circuits before, but
I am not sure how well they work in practice.

In this case, I'd like something which will amplify sufficiently

I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that
when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is
necessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan
monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which
mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
standard selections.  For this reason, I use the
""factory defaults"" for position/size on the ATI card
and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)
at the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan
monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings
the next time each mode is ""detected"".

Introduction:

	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation
	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)
	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)
	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)
	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)
	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)

	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer
	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).
	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
	comp.os.os2.bugs.

	This document contains:
	*  the background showing the need for these proposals
	*  the proposed charters for these proposals
	*  voting instructions
	*  a voting ballot
	*  some example ballots
	*  the voting rules
	*  the voting schedule
	*  the Mass Acknowledgement


Background:

	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2
	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such
	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,
	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.

	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and
	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the
	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility
	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
	procedures, etc.

	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows
	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).

	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,
	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.
	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
	comp.os.os2.misc for details).


Proposed Charters:

	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
		spur additional development.  The group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,
		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program
		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and
		so forth.

	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.

	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the
		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
		performance optimization.

	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.

	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug
		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in
		comp.os.os2.beta]


How to Vote:

Voting Rules:

	* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most
	  recent vote will be counted.

	* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,
	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.

	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings
	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.

	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will
	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).

	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is
	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.

	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal
	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:
	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes
	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).
	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the
	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).
	  In other words, a proposal passes if:
	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)
	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.


Schedule:

	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted

This leads me to believe that it's not really a rabbitball year, and that
we've just had a rash of high-scoring games.  I bet this one day's worth
of games pulled everything back to close to average.

Interesting, because the other day, all but three games had ten or more
runs scored, and yesterday no game had more than nine."

17,"THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH
 
     (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training
videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military
arm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures
significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel
deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to
Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer
version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which
obtained and translated the tape.)
 
     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a
refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished
high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work
for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have
two daughters.
     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine
explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is
Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and
women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]
Security Services.
     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,
cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most
important objective must be to put an end to the plague of
collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and
interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose
the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into
collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,
we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.
     We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70
percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into
their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is
based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many
collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli
Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.
He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an
Israeli soldier.
     There's another group of collaborators who perform an even
more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men
and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become
collaborators. I regard the ""isqat"" [the process by which a
Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as
greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is
guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious
duty to execute him.
     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the
distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the
Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their
victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and
impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the
drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.
     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of
uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent
person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished
forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after
evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If
after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any
doubt, then he is executed.
     In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against
collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty.
But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a
collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for
evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be
irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually
obtained in the form of a confession.
     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start
off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell
him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the
last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the
information we need.
     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has
been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them
confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply
pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts
confess as well.
     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an
interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working
for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself
confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the
information to us. In addition, three members of his network of
collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this
much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are
very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our
principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he
himself confesses his crimes. 
     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of
collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be
executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of
names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not
mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for
execution.
     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But
after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him
-- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators
are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, ""What do you
think? How should we execute you?"" One collaborator told us,
""Strangle me."" He hated the sight of blood.

I grew up in New York City so I rode in many Checker cabs.  The jump
seats were fun as a kid.  Although the cars were roomy -- a good trait
for a taxi -- they had a design flaw that I don't understand they never
fixed: the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the
driver braked.  I wouldn't want to take a long ride in the back seat of
one of these vehicles.  Why did you like yours?  I never drove one, so
I have to ask."

other vendors as well.  The EMX system for OS/2 gives you most of the
standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under
OS/2.  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs
directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with
UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.  And, best of
all, EMX is free.  :-)

There is a similar system (GO32) for DOS, but it doesn't work with
Windows, as far as I know.


Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows, neither of
which is a standalone OS at this point.  Neither OS/2 nor UNIX requires
DOS.

What they would need to do, though, is make sure that nobody has
access to decent crypto in the first place.  They probably can't
tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they
get their copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to use
encryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoid
this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.

I probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use
of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical
properties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then
detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase
the measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this would
be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.

I really don't understand all this!  I watched on satellite network feeds as  
perhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames,  
and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. 

Something was VERY wrong with that scene.

Perhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies, I might've been dulled to the pain of  
fellow humans dying.

Thank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think  
they got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was  
the sadistic mad man they said he was, did the others deserve his fate?   If,  
in fact, he was mad, wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his  
followers, and therefore they were innocent, brainwashed, victims?  Is there  
any scenaro that justifies all that death?

And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has  
not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over  
the edge.

And that's if you buy the latest version of the ""story"" hook, line, and sinker.   
I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment  
to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.

Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no  
witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they  
had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the  
building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back  
the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.   
Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any  
other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private
property, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license
is required only for the use of public roads.


We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and
usually only two candidates for a given office. A President
might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create
a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to)
and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the
civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote
for the ""lesser of two evils."" I don't think this is a matter
of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York
and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to 
create a virtual ban.


In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws:
According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals
legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's
the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing
guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish
this.


How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for
owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting,
target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't
their only (or even a common) use.


I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation
of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different,
in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that
primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had
not done anything wrong.


A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal 
with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course,
it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But
at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social
problems? 


There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes.
In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places
where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those
where guns are less common.


This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government
and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish
or restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some
vague ""common good."" "

Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. 

As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was
a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They
said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low 
numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked
great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! 
It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  
I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those 
who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  
( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should
be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about 
the transmission and taking my chances.

terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they
massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing
to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their

Look for edge inconsistencies.  Consider two vertices, p and q, which
are connected by at least one edge.

If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.  

If *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface ""flips"" when
you travel across that edge.  This is bad.  

Assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise
acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the
surface enforcing consistency with that edge.  

    0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as ""OK""
    1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)
       make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face
       should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which
       are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as ""OK"",
       and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially
       inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)). 
    2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).

If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.

If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you
lose. 
    
Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means
that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding
which way is OUT is left as an exercise...

And I maintain:

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by
their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs
under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the
darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.
These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded
at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,
after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,
they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places
they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes.

They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under
a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great
-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.

Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be
a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the
long hike, but it's well worth it!


Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much
different as your god is from them...

Don't you see?  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness
with my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not
something as mega-powerful as what you're trying to get me to accept.
Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good
*reason* to, don't you?


When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead
of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity
decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.


Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable
place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little
sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.

You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or
Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how
can you say you have an open mind?


Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a
good life.


Please do.


I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god

So I should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to
Islam. Or, to convert me to ANYTHING. 

There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.

'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or
my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.

This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some
friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches
and cheap booklets about some church ....

And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert 
everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.


Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related
violence' ?

research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State

are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by
criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in
this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when
you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because
of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding
private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study
of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%

the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and

the completion rate drops to 3%.

MAGI: 

[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
 ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
 _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
 most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
 second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
 the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
 to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]

  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain 
etymology. It may originally have meant ""member of the tribe,"" as in the
Avestan compound mogu-tbish (""hostile to a member of the tribe""). This meaning
would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to ""member of the priestly
tribe"" and perhaps to ""priest"" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is
probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the ""Magoi"" as one of
the six tribes of the Medes.
  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a
priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were
responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their
knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median
priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median
monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century
through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the
Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political
and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced
concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period
(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is
demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by
Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by
Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of
the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.
  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the
sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the
possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be
attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.
  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi
are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of
the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is
untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the
Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, ""gift""), is
not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,
in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of
purity, or separation of the ""mixture"" of the two opposed principles of spirit
and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as ""chorus,"" from
the root mangh, which is said to mean ""sing the magic song"" (Nyberg, 1966) and
has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an
ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though
there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms
magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the
Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite
a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore
the Avestan term for ""priest,"" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is 
perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis 
(Gershevitch, 1964).
  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the
Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in
particular derives from an older form, magupati (""head of the Magi""). During
the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of
a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (""the high priest of
high priests"") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical
hierarchy.
  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,
khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of
the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.
The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons
of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian
community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the
Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this
rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was
in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with
wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples
of Central Asia.
  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to
offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a
ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the
custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the
relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was
called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also
known for the practice of killing harmful, or ""Ahrimanical,"" animals (khrafstra)
such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,
tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of
felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose
and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their
breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition
that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was
that of the priesthood: white.
  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in
possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they
gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of
professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally
inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been
jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this
they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible
for teaching the prince the ""magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes"" and thus
the ""cult of the gods."" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with
the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and
master of himself.
  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great
influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite
several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of
Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself
Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -
the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,
in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed
as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.
  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were
renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of
the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men
who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in
Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were
also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;
this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,
like ""goes,"" ""expert in the magic arts"" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the
Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and
had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.
  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it
is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called
western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must
have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the
Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in
contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in
varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.
  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their
varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical
historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their
customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,
belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology
and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi
even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the
Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted
Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and
placed themselves under his venerable name.
  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the
eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those
elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite
often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the
Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, ""the law-abjuring
daivas""), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of
texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and
practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first
chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the
supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;
Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of
all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the
land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it
has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the
absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own
priesthood, would be very strange.
  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the
corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the
first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute
directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to
us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of
the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles
of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (""beneficent
spirit"") and Angra Mainyu (""hostile spirit"") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra
Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-
formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-
astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the
Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known
to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can
see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which
we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]
  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously
important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in
the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their
natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of
Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began
to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,
Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises
on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have
survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of
wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority
of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an
abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).
  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]
  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the
religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,
1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of
Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to
establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an
orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures
in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar
and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century."

14,"I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining
one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can
be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at
mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.

Mark proposed this design, which he calls ""Geode"" (""rough on the
outside, but a gem on the inside"") or the ""ET Strongback with
integrated hab modules and centrifuge.""  As you can see from file
geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much
of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The
white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte
Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)
pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting
can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass
properties of the Station change during assembly.

The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because
it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong
part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are
limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the
docking system.

The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional
launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit
(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never
had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to
(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual
de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the
residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from
impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a
Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating
the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing
further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,
it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the
nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.

The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment
Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used
for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system
which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a
controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we
did with Skylab).

The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be
used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity
on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device
for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on
one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.

This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,
data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work
done to date.

Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,
and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors
I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
seems more likely.

Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;
you should see his notes in the GIF files.

In what still, IMHO, ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to
mention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed, GM Eddie Johnston and
Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the Captain's ""C"" in December of 1990. The whole organization (read:
EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all
season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly 
humiliating him, stripping him of the ""C"", and then trading him that Spring
to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.

The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of
decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.

acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the

	I have a Humminbird HDR200 Depth Sounder for sale. It
has been used for 1 season on my sailboat. 
	
	All parts are included as well as the installation
instructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There
is no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer
was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.
So it led a ""sheltered"" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside
the hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole
drilled into your hull.

	It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2"" hole in a bulkhead
(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a
powerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has
an adjustable shallow water alarm built in. 

	I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
outputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine

	It is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.

The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the

Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1,

channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a
channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many
sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.
Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the
only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an

Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get

Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused
""objective morality"" to look very ""relative.""  After all, that was the
point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out
Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own
principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this
apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:

If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then
He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick
physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an ""objective"" morality for us.
That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or
detrimental to) the creature He created. 

	Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in
	Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared
	beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.

However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees
of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list
of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a
person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be
applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's
""objective"" morality for us. 

Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of
rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have
both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the
principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.
Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the
application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with
the ""subjectivity"" of principles. 

	For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference
	between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in
	verses 21-22:  ""You have heard that the ancients were told,
	'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall
	be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is
	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court...""

The ""objective morality"" of God gets blurred by our inept
interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors
when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY
what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to
seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all
figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's
""objective morality"" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he
was/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS ""objective
morality."" "
15,"It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the
tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.
As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was
more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin
for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)
Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with
a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition
because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science
discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that
Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.

Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She 
refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old 
would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed
to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.

RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that
being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition."

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed ""Pro-Life"" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to
even the most brutal Arab tyrants.

Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans

You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post
you stated that the ""wrap"" was on top of and in addition to any overhead.
Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.


Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing
what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum
attack and you know it.


Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any
organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
a program and ""wrap"" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap
was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
say is not true. Which is it Allen?


As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and
above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.
Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some
numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.


Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was 
done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of
Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are
completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There
is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project
that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for 
Apollo?


Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.
They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just
how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what
they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. 


I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that
integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called
leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for
the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership
and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up
as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC
and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to
finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the
process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.

There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that
for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the
turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is
lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of
leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a
symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your
efforts that you do not see this.


No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have 
happened in the first place.

I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally
ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that
has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to

Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is
based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you
have a hockey background. Stats like ""plus/minus"" make RBI look good.


OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that ""had Morris
performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.""

will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it
is a part of it.  


Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
within their borders?  

[...]

You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?
Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header
in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey
has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is 
the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the
negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri 
towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's 
going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the 
line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically
and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be
neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?

If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes
your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their
blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize 
craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians
in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate 
as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in
the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for
compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading
inflammatory half-truths.

15,": I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged
: couple become ""married"" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have
: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and
: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective
: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.

The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*
married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.

e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall
leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''
(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).

If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the
phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This
implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the
point of intercourse.

Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary
was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were
*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which
required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary
and Joseph went to bed together.

Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is
described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes 
place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with
Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will
take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,
because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.

In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is
not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the
point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the
civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)
Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a
marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since
Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be
corrected on that point!)

This view obviously raises some questions:

What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering
marriage. Are those people also ``married''?

If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary
to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours
the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep
together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-
honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before
actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and
also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive
to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)

Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that 
the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi 
party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red
herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of 
the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using 
homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that
Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse
official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts
right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in
a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of
homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it
is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt
it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his
former right hand man was a homosexual?). 

Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references 
to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the 
night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even 
the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, 
this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 
1920's.


Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the
paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with 
homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know 
what tainted ""evidence"" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made 
by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those 
accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 
1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in 
time and plant ""tainted"" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers 
which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being 
obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter
do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in 
these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a 
false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point 
here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof 
falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework 
before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.


This is just about the *only* thing we agree on. 

I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and 
his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling
seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this
must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what
lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this
is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If 
you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them 
and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from 
their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and
tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my
specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time
trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.


Given that you already consider all evidence ""tainted"", what on earth would
constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been
considered ""shrewd guesses""?

I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -
historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious 
footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually 
provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place 
to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.

I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My
apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods
are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject

Personally I'd prefer the mono-screen as I always have quite a few windows

color 'surplus' is worth trading in  the smaller size. If you want to

I hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify
some things so I won't get flamed.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a
``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in
the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are
not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to
repeat this every time.

I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group''
property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have
thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a
cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means
nothing at all.

Then I wrote,


What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the
cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for
a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be
broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people
would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit
from better technology in the same way.

Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.

The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move
around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]

Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded
for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope
of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).

I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this
before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:

1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a
packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the ""jaggies.""  I'm
now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).
Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,
thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?

2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort
the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.
Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared
shape?

Currently I take:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64

and produce:
            
             1  2  3  4
33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8
49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12
            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16
                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32
                                    61 62 63 64

Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.
Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.
This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But
it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?
Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap
already skewed?

Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?
I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.
Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.

[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)
*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to
be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside
of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.
This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to
change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this
approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough
distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in
a real perspective drawing.

Hopefully the ""context"" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches
hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.

Thanks in advance for any help.

  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging
     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done

	Yup.  Unfortunately, as has been pointed out, the cost of insurance
does NOT go down with No Fault.  The crappiest drivers make out like bandits
because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for
insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy
drivers.  The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of
the crappy drivers' actions, and that's not fair.

	Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of
shit, because the rest of us end up paying more.

	Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is
also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are
inherently less safe than slower drivers, and the NHTSA disproved that two
years ago now.

How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?


If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel
active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device.
So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how
all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
to the ISA-AT bus at the same time.

Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,

2,"Well, I'm amazed at how successful this exercise was. I received 20
responses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made it
possible.

On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase
and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application
that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL
string and receive the results.

Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other 
products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,
RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.

For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C
portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the
source code, and portability is important in my application. It works
with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.

However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising.
It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and
formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp,
except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals:
the ""ODBC Programmer's Reference"" and the ""ODBC SDK Guide"". Moreover,
ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's 
up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,
it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK). 
Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should
make life interesting in the future.

Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by 
a line of asterisks (*).


****************************************************************************

Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want. 
The current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox
4.0.  (Why the versions are different, I don't know. PD Engine 2.0 was
compatible with Pdox 3.0 and 3.5...).  It consists of a rather broad
library of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal (I think
turbo Pascal 5.5 and up) and C (I think either Microsoft or Borland).

Now.. reading the box... it's ""Borland Paradox Engine & Database
Frameworks"".  Works with any Borland C/C++, Mocrosoft C 6.01 or later,
Turbo C++ for Windows, Turbo Pascal 6.0 or later, TP for Windows 1.0 or
later.  For Framework applications, BC++ 3.0 or later or MS C/C++ 7.0. It
does have support for object useage...

I haven't had a real chance to really use it myself... but it looks fairly
complete... I'm planning to use it this summer.

the Paradox for Windows was impemented on top of it.

  MS has put their ODBC SDK into the public domain; it's
 _big_ (I believe 1.8 MB), but worth downloading over a
 fast link. Look at ftp.uu.net in vendor/microsoft/odbc-sdk.

 Also some companies are starting to provide SQL engines; I
 just got one for RBASE, not exactly cheap at $450, but it
 allows programs in C or VBASIC (under DOS or Windows) to talk
 to data bases using SQL functions in your code.

Borland sells the Paradox Engine -- which has all the Paradox calls in it.
Its hardly SQL though.  You can do searches on key fields and on 
indivual fields, but no comparison operators like <, >=....

so its pretty painful (in my opinion) do do anything besides simple
retrieval and inserts/updates.

I'm currently using it (I have an eval copy..) and I've linked it in to
some entry screens I've written.

The Engine library adds about 100K to the size of the program, but you can
load it as an overlay using Borland's VROOM manager.

Now Borland claims that later versions of the engine will have SQL support
but they don't really expect it till late in the year... or even next year
They are trying to get thrid parties to help out..

If you have any other questions -- let me know...

Yes, borland sells their Paradox Engine separately.  It has C, C++, and
Pascal interfaces, although the underlying interface is in 'C'. Well at
least for version 2.0 of the Engine which I have (costed $99 at Egghead).
They now have version 3.0 of the engine, and a separate C++ class package
for it.

The C libraries come in both DOS and Windows flavors (the win stuff 
being dll's).  

When I got it, it also came with Crystal Reports which
is a graphical report generator.  It allows you to create a generic

something like $50-$60 for an upgrade from the earlier version though...

I'm currently developing an app. with Borland's ""Paradox Engine

w/3.5).  There are indeed C libs for Fox access, but I can't think of the
names offhand - I'm sure someone has already written you in that regard -
(I think I just saw an add for a Fox lib in the ""C Users Journal"", which
is a good place to look for this type of package in general, by the way).
I've been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of PX Eng. over the
past year - wouldn't recommend it for a complex multiuser app.--but I'm
staying with it for now--it's like a bad marriage: I've got too much time
invested in learning and work-arounds!  But if your interest is limited
to a simple single-user interface (you want to build your own SQL engine,
I take it), PX Engine will do the job easily - it doesn't sound like
you'll be bumping into any of the gotchas.  If you do, write me; I may
be able to point you in the right direction.

What format does Apple's Quicktime use for their products?  I guess

I hate to defend Ed (the article was very poorly written) but here goes:


Italy's per-capita debt is much higher than USA's.



This is *exactly* what the public in France & Italy perceive to be the
problem-- thus the French election and Italian pulizia.


Regarding the post-pulizia Italy:

Wrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord.
The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style
first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would
encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy.
Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will
be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties
will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.

(The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with
Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a
portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)

Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians
are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and
Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party
system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

Ryan> Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not.

This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing
layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.
Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner
compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or
delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years
following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose
up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have
a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.

Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and
other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the
comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously
degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of
""parking your lid"" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the
comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly
damaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet."

18,"In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the
scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political
implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it
is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed
followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political
lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.




Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does
this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder
because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent
supporter?

One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system
was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party
itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was
noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not
originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it
until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged
upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of 
his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the
old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications
of their rhetoric. 

This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must
be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one ""race""
of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of
humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,
the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who
lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the
evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.
Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego
cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however
mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and
his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can
produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be 
emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between
a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to 
govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the
latter as a ""strong"" government since most displays of strength are made
necessary by an essential weakness.

It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they
amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the
same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause
of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their
logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties
such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert
the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates
of a system that would commit genocide. 

The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is
inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let
the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that
were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of
the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly
does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.

No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon 
election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.
If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made
the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates
a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many
in government politics is a method of providing a justification for
their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A 
rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the
continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the
essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli
which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important
to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right
and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement
of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.
In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through
their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.

It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics
of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The
leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do
so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a 
task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of
ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore
in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole
before personal concerns, even of personal security.

Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred
and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit
genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of
the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility
of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to 
control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot 
affect the system.

     unsealed, it is CLEAR that Clinton and Reno supported an
     ILLEGAL raid.  Did they not KNOW this?

     NO authority to use helicopters.

who have experienced the problem and found a workable solution.


Many people are interested, but have no input.  I will restate that your last

I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were
system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen - it freezes.

I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at
startup.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured
twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time.

Anyone out there with these same problems?

There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can
cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies
widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults
pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia)
is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae
is the most common cause.

What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis,
which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in
both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism
is also called the ""meningococcus"", and is the source of the
common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in
the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases),
the organism typically causes death within a day. 

This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats
of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different
ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. 

Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts
of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.

Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis
is a huge topic, and sci.med can't do it justice.

Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to
say the original poster is already familiar with such stories.
Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about
MSG making people ill. 

Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether
literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster
no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome' is bogus.

Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of
what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo
effects; people may have allergies in addition. 


Have you read Olney's work? I fail to see how citing results from
peer-reviewed studies qualifies as ""bizarrely cracked"".


Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC.
Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies,
for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk.


Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the
journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?

But, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four
times less sensitive than humans to MSG.


The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids.
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.

Olney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount
of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods,
vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed
foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.



Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles
disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever.

then XPut'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome, so the animation is
slower to load than with Sunview. Is there a better way to load in the
data?


Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,
Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some
documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server-

This sounds a bit high to me.  Still higher accelerations have been endured

No, the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common
forms of meningitis.  It's the one that sometimes sweeps
schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking
the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose
and the brain to swell up.

It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time,
however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible
to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who
becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where
a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also
occur.


It can live in the throat of carriers.  Don't worry, you won't get 
it from them, especially if they took the medication.

For me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly
and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws
of the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,
I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been
publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not in
the habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with 
was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so
clear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or
homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If
I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing
several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence
in court (""If it really was self-defence,"" the prosecuter would
ask, ""why did you run away and hide from the police?"")

In other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:
If someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence
he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of
that city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would be
between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible
conviction for half a dozen. "

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS


                          The Briefing Room


 10:10 A.M. EDT
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon 
to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out 
the first pitch.
	     
	     Q	  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not 
Amtrack.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's 
going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.
	     
	     Q	  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to 
break the logjam with  ??? Senate?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are 
discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, 
and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point 
that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs 
to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for 
summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the 
important programs that will put people back to work right away this 
summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be 
passed.
	     
	     Q	  Will he compromise, that's the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions 
are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and 
Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President 
believes his jobs program should go forward.
	     
	     Q	  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 
billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise 
being offered by --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being 
offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right 
now, let's see what happens today.
	     
	     Q	  Would he go that far -- no matter what the 
Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per 
year?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his 
program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be 
willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to 
come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's 
see what happens.
	     
	     Q	  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has 
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order 
to get a vote?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more 
intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in 
doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the 
Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the 
President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, 
real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no 
question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative 
activity over the last few days.
	     
	     Q	  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the 
conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.
	     
	     Q	     prepared to compromise --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen 
to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting 
with Senator Dole. 
	     
	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's 
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.
	     
	     Q	  How?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record 
time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by 
$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for 
important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong 
passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a 
minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock 
and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that 
he is not succeeding overall.
	     
	     Q	  He can't beat this, can he?
	     
	     Q	  The fact is they can do that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop 
action.  There's no question about that.
	     
	     Q	  What are you going to do about it?
	     
	     Q	  George, what do you know about these alleged notes 
taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears 
that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that 
when they say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete 
misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the 
conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring 
President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime 
Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's 
belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  
I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and 
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where 
he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese 
were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when 
the Japanese say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the 
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say 
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime 
Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the 
Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and 
there appears to be --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the 
Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It 
does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of 
view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that 
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up 
but I'm not positive.
	     
	     Q	  George, was the specific comment that was made 
specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general 
observation on Japanese etiquette?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --
	     
	     Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that 
has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, ""when the 
Japanese say yes they mean no.""
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean 
I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific 
comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific 
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that 
Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.
	     
	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual 
observation.
	     
	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to 
clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President 
spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but 
I'm not sure exactly how many.
	     
	     Q	  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're 
making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got 
the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that 
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no 
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the 
Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure 
there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is 
on.
	     
	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they 
may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese 
is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two 
days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime 
Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. 
position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the 
Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's 
commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a 
constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to 
hear that.
	     
	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq 
for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. 
policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary 
Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have 
reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance 
with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.
	     
	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, 
Saddam can't stay in office?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our 
judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with 
the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that 
we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will 
continue to demand it.
	     
	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the 
dominant power in the area --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also 
spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect 
full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping 
support of terrorism.
	     
	     Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in 
power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you 
base that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not 
complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the 
rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is 
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  
He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding 
armaments.
	     
	     Q	  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he 
would be out of power?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on 
the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make 
it more difficult for him to stay in power.
	     
	     Q	  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it 
that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure 
politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence 
do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical 
difference with you that's in good faith?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times 
in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the 
fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now 
seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  
	     
	     Q	  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate 
Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to 
them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had 
one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate 
Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and 
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -
-
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true 
that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the 
Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the 
introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate 
Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are 
continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who 
have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in 
what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is 
important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.
	     
	     Q	     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats 
alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is 
no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can 
frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  
You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going 
and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.
	     
	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get 
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of 
the summer?
	     
	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some 
Republicans into your camp?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to 
look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the 
President's intiatives?
	     
	     Q	  But on this one -- how are you going to do it 
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you 
really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear 
that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and 
could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  
Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for 
particular votes?  When you have to go through --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and 
understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the 
President's going to continue to reach out when he can.
	     
	     Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you 
have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your 
approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this 
experience?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like 
his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue 
to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, 
there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with 
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this 
case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around 
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.
	     
	     Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of 
putting their proposals forward.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --
	     
	     Q	     any ideas.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being 
defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.
	     
	     Q	     to present them.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean 
they get the votes --
	     
	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the 
parliamentary rules under which they're playing.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in 
support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.
	     
	     Q	  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration 
backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?
	     
	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for 
Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of 
grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at 
some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about 
anything recently.
	     
	     Q	     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the 
President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be 
some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the 
President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider 
something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President 
appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a 
special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around 
the California economic situation, including the situation in Los 
Angeles.  
	     
	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles 
by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, 
Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD 
Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits 
by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I 
wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to 
California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is 
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy 
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities 
which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to 
watch it.
	     
	     Q	  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also 
supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a 
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball 
management.  Does the President have a position on that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received 
correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson 
has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  
He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in 
baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the 
President intends to continue to go to the ball game.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see 
Reverend Jackson while he's out there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see 
them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has 
raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, 
even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.
	     
	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball 
game?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe 
the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an 
informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to 
the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining 
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the 
President read it.
	     
	     Q	  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the 
managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be 
there, and is he going to meet with the President?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
	     
	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is 
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a 
lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice 
President Gore.
	     
	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, 
yes.
	     
	     Q	  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did 
warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist 
activities?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, 
I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been 
general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a 
long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I 
mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there 
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  
The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also 
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.
	     
	     Q	  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, 
apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, 
forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at 
the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in 
their attempts to get some kind of action.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would 
agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did 
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a 
network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate 
action.  But there was no specific information on this specific 
operation at all.
	     
	     Q	  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the 
law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have 
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in 
not pursuing some kind of --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.
	     
	     Q	  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing 
mention in the news conference yesterday --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your 
question.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted 
action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what 
does the U.S. do next?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going 
to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our 
allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways 
to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an 
agreement.
	     
	     Q	  George, why do you think sanctions is still an 
option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the 
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait 
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day 
said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any 
time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When 
does no mean no and you have to do something different?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something 
different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the 
U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to 
try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every 
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.
	     
	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? 
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something 
that is under consideration.
	     
	     Q	  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's 
condition, how he's doing?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.
	     
	     Q	  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think 
we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning 
after the Mubarak visit.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.
	     
	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid 
to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with 
the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  
I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their 
delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the 
Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the 
next several weeks.
	     
	     Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude 
of the one announced Sunday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the 
magnitude.
	     
	     Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where 
do you stand on that --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, 
he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week 
and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this 
week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a 
hard look at it.
	     
	     Q	  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White 
House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the 
congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll 
be able to get our own researchers working as well.
	     
	     Q	  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a 
probability than a possibility?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under 
discussion.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter 
of time and -- for months before that happens.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's 
something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working 
with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll 
continue to review other matters.
	     
	     Q	  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule 
this week?  Any travel?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I 
don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right 
now.
	     
	     Q	  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish 
American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference 
of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National 
Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  
We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate 
discussions.
	     
	     Thanks.

I've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me.  I

Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.  It is Armenian

organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns
repeatedly.  

I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion.  Turkey had the right to

1,"Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the
process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 
and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent
Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through 
June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with 
ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge 
tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.
 
X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:
 
1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types
   available through a large collection of X resources.
2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.
3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.
4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.
5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget 
   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar 
   to X programmers.
6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.
   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical
   layout of an application.
 
C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:
 
1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library
   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C
   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.
2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse 
   interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control
   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.
3. Large collection of high-level application functions for ""two-call""
   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available
   with minimal programming effort.
4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling
   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot
   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can 
   control the event loop.

	The quick answer:  Revelation 12:7-9

	""And there was war in heaven.  Michael and his angels fought against
	the dragon and his angels who fought back.  But he [the dragon] was
	not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.  The great
	dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent, called the devil and
	Satan, who leads the whole world astray.  He was hurled down to the
	earth, and his angels with him.""

	The earlier part of chapter 12 deals (very symbolically) with why
	Satan rose up in battle against Michael and the good angels in the
	first place."
8,"   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, 
   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler
back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled
Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you 
can't really communicate.

Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how
they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately
and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning
thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a
pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay
perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn
and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always
screws up the line I've picked out.

Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:
	- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.
	- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not
	  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount
	  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)
	- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)
	- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many
	  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)
	- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and
	  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're
	  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel
	  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  
	- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be 
	  gradual, so I can compensate.
	- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.
	- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right 
	  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how
	  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to
	  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to 
	  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, 
	  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, ""SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED"" 
	  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with 
	  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.
	  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the
	  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her
	  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to 
	  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)

Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, 
tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.
Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.

Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little
mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will
be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.
It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the 
first trip!

Good luck -- have fun!"

Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be
the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard
is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very
poorly written.  But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such
as the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of

Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victory...easily.

I watched most of the game on ESPN (as soon as I realized that they
were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second).
The Maple Leafs were flat.  Very flat.  Meanwhile, the Red Wings were
skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game.  I didn't
detect any bad penalty calls (Van Hellemond did his usual good job).
Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff
game in a few years -- nervous.

For the Leafs sake, I hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies
for game 2.  If game 1 is indicative of the series, it's gonna go
quick."
7,"Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the
fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel
was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage
than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their
350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big
mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine
could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with
these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --
DON""T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.

Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,
LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper
in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?
Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?
No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a
500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.

I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.
Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline
engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that 
when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350
engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about
$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long
and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine
costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection
pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,
you never need a tune-up.

If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.
Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also."

Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun, IBM, HP +++ (can't remeber the
other members in the recent announcement), I'm sure you'll see it on
virtually every workstation (ie. Sun, IBM, HP and DEC must make up the
**VAST** majority of all hardware).




Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about
$100.  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
redistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups
pertaining to Motif has been high.




I can't see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif
by default and you can buy it for under $100 for the ""free"" UNIX
platforms, I can't see this causing major problems.


Side Note :
---------
All the X based code I am writing (and will distribute freely when
completed) is based on Motif because from a programmatic and also ""look
and feel"" point of view I like it the best (no flames on this one
please).

I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.
It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise.
I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better.

The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
people. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person
because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it is
not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals 
why the hatred? So that makes me think that there is some kind of
brainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated person 
treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your 
history books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 (""ruggedized"") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.

It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the

This is not true.  The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the
existence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests
or straight from their own scriptures as the ""proof"", this does not 
satisfy atheists.

Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as
you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they
got up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc.
represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.


Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of
us that makes us ask the question ""Does God exist?"" i.e. self-awareness and
reason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant
as the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?

You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if
we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since
we can only use faith, why is one picture of ""God"" (e.g. Hinduism) any less
valid than another (e.g. Christianity)?

In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and
(Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do
with the discussion at hand? :-)

When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which
allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about
classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal
characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question
from scratch.

What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema
to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.

Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus
crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that ""aura of deterrence,"" critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.
This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
""contribution to society.""  I view that doctrine as being both (a)
personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of
the 14th Amendment.

Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any
profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking
members of the Executive Branch of the federal government."

be ready to run with a pre-written government-slanted story on this in
the next issue.  ('Just keep us some pages spare boys, we'll give you

We *must* get big names in the industry to write well argued pieces against
this proposal (can you call it that when it's a de facto announcement?) and
get them into the big magazines before too much damage is done.

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0
and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to
appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would
be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.

[stuff deleted]


No Integra I have seen comes with all-season tires. 
The GTZ does come with much bigger 16"" wheels.


The C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype
supplied by Acura. The MT figures are more plausible.

16.1 sounds reasonable, probably faster than regular Integras.


The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed
box more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra
equals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.


The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It
was a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.


The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k
miles, a rare screw up by Honda.
Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take
the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR.

2,"This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing
the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The
proposed groups are described below:

NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup
STATUS:  Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.

NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc
STATUS:	 Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,
	 including issues such as security, networking features, console
	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.

RATIONALE:
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an ""OS"").  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June '93.

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-
	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking
	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for
	Windows 3.1.

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses
	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-
	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and
	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.

	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family:
		comp.os.ms-windows.apps
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 3.1:
		comp.os.ms-windows.announce
		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
	
	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating
	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies.

	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --
	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-
	generation Windows, ""Chicago"", debuts next year, surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?


DISCUSSION PERIOD:
	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  

VOTING:
	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV."

Therefore, you need to achieve 4:1 to get standard voice quality.

If you're willing to give up some quality, you need only 2:1.  This is still

Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior.
A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said
that people would come to Him saying ""Lord, Lord,"" and proclaiming
the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell
them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to
depart from Him.  

That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual
sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would
not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent.
But people should be careful not to think, ""God has given me a gift of
the Spirit, it must be okay to be gay.""  That is dangerous (see also hebrews
6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of 
the world to come.)


Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves
out of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our
nature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the
morality that God has set forth.  

If you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant,
then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's.
Is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the
homosexual's or the one considered ""ignorant?"""

A.  Folks, do we have an FAQ on tinnitus yet?

B.  As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist
who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following
are reasonable conclusions:

1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.
2. The cause it not understood.
3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it.
4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but
there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with
any of these experimental drugs.
5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.
6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes
abates or goes away after a few months.
7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.
8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.
9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on
something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.
10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.
11.  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there
is not."

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be

of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on
situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower

Okay, now here's my interpretation of _Boomer_, based on the facts as
presented in the New York Court of Appeals<*> holding (_Boomer v.

<*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York
   State.  While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their
   highest court ""Supreme Court,"" ""Supreme Judicial Court"" or ""Supreme
   Court of Appeals,"" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the
   ""Court of Appeals.""  To make matters worse, New York also calls its
   _second-highest_ court the ""Supreme Court, Appellate Division""...

Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):

Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's
plant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to
which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he
defendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course
of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the
plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the
plant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked
the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.

(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned
their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.
Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)

Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court
ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided
that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In
other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the
power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment
of their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is
always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a
private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.

(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if
it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks
like eminent domain...)

Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that
""What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the
plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million
dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.""  Blackmail?

    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....
    ""Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to
    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose
    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under
    extortion statutes."")

How do you define as ""blackmail"" one party's act of demanding the right
to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns
and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of
demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see
it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of
owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to
stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price
they wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says
that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.

You go on to say: ""The plant would never have been shut down -- the
plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,
because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to
having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less
than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.""

If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from
other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those
other parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice
between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,
shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_
business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_
the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was
Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type
of plant they did where and when they did.)

And then you say: ""Everyone's property rights were protected; the
plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.""
As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were ""made whole.""
They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners
of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price
acceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made
whole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of ensuring that ""unnecessary"" settlement costs are avoided?
(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were
supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)


(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as ""infamous,"" at least not at my
school.

(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for
their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first
encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal
opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get
into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick
and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional
Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly
and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously
intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly
biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors
tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is
especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are
practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_
educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat
cloistered scholar.  End of aside.)

I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons
I've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can
only call ""economic correctness"" over justice.

(2) It is ""completely sensible"" only if you believe that the alleged
right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid
losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and
the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to
not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who
own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.
(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other
branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take
other people's property by eminent domain.)


Really?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say
about cases like _Boomer_?


I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to
as ""law and economics"" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical
analysis as one of many ""tie-breaker"" factors which courts may use to
help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by
the scale of ""justice"", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by
_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics
of a case as being more important than the justice of a case."

This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's
Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's
Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But
I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did
well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's
presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at
the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be
that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.
---
Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.
Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top
players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in 
Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.
Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on
Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high
as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the ""dynasty"" talk
isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an
advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,
won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably
play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the
North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top 
Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a 
couple of years the same way Edmonton's ""dynasty"" crumbled in the late '80s. 
Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an 
exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a 
compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during 
the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, 
the amateur draft should be open to anyone.

That's 100% of the people I know with DOS 6.0. Both have

fine, only to compress C: to have the thing choke, spit out an unintelligable

the drive, I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known

The other may have been a marginal drive, however, his upgrade failed,

I had no knowledge of Phil's attempts in this.  I do not even *know* for

Roger, though I *believe* that was at least the case for versions prior

import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build
their teams around local players.

Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you

disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating
practices need to be reexamined...


No, but mating practices are a special case.  I'll have to think about it
some more.


Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems
are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural
system is a subset of the objective ones.


I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although
it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that
homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean ""bisexuality?""

These players all are pretty good players.  They are the depth that the

Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it
were not for the depth provided by these players.

They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good
players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who
provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.

As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That
doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians
had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could

These new rule changes are great!  However, I think that your rules are
MUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to count
how many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the
names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  And, of
course, there will have to be new ""sub-positions"", like the power center
who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,
and the ""shooting defenseman"" and the ""point defenseman"".  Finally, we'll
be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. 
Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to
see Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.

4,"Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for
$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were
intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining
5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.

Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.
Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I
then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the
IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me
another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see
the drive there's a definite hardware problem.

Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send
me a *new* one, but they said ""no."" Also, within three weeks after I purchased
my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.

I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And
I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these
facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that
when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again
reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data
recovery.)

It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still
covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. 

I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La
Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.
But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent
a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I
asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even 
have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)

What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any
other products from La Cie in the future.

Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this
growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the
investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from
any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been
behind it.  What's going on here?

Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.
I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops
because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business
negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR
knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a
psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had
professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was
emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from
civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their
isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious
orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as
the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being
consumed in the apocalypse.

IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated
psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of
action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly
appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the
tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.
They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,
obstensibly to perform ""gas insertions"" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push
him over the edge.

Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV
earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical
role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno
on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)
claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true
they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they
were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and
reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at
the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and
would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the
""gas insertion"" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image
that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back
and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.

Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without
bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency
interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation
of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.

The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,
abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the
armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited
his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A
simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell
how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not
have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the
compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the
FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the
revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without
all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to
show the world how big her balls are.

Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my 
very soul.

15,"Mark Ashley's account of private revelation does not, as some might
think, contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church
believes that public revelation, on which Catholic doctrine is based,
ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  In that posting
I made sure I used the word ""public"".  Public revelation contains
God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained
in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private
revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak
directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the
Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to
believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed.
Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations,
but doctrines can not.

When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the
Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood
that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be
approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However,
it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from
God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most
well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those
at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject
Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not
mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)

I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in
evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need
every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that
nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything
known through public revelation

Gawd, I love Windows :-)


You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them
fresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.


You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a
swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky
stuff in a PC environment.


A reasonably accurate prediction...


Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:

There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,
and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined
notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.

The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,
and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not
important right now.

The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find
the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the
number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it
holds a ""magic"" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad
(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster
contains the next section of the file.

The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.
The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is
doled out in ""chunks"" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster
is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.

To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the
starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.
Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will
tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.
Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump
around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a
time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker
which says it's the last cluster in the file.

CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of
the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into
submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to
double-check anything it ""fixes"".

Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:


All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match
the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter
the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the
directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.
But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,
obviously, are made up.))


Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached
to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these
""lost chains"" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK
through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell
CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply
be marked ""available"" in the FAT.



...


These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,
one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that
C:\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...

To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.
This will ""fix"" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.
Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to
assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  ""Missing pieces"" are
likely to be found in those ""lost chains"" at the top...)


Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of
the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an
amount which exceeded available disk space...

In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.
There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage
after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the
problem occurs.  Sorry.

1,"Actually I am trying to write something like this but I encounter some
problems, amongst them:

- drawing a 3d wireframe view of a quadric/quartic requires that you have
the explicit equation of the quadric/quartic (x, y, z functions of some
parameters). How to convert the implicit equation used by PoV to an
explicit one? Is it mathematically always possible?"

Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I
believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this?
Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which
you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are
attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you.
Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you
because your god doesn't exist.


I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.
What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.


Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain 
knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the
Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and
there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond
our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  
to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a
person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find 
something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one
will gain with that attitude is folly.

Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages
in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even
though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.
Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such
deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. 
I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, ""You will never
be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.""


From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):

    ""It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.""


Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:

   ""No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.""


And in John 3:16:

   ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
   life.""


You are included in ""whosoever"".  And I also pray that the Father is
drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting
to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the
making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure
stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became
on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.

You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because
you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack
Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,
proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.

Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would 
probably say to you: ""Satan would surely like to have you.""  Why so?
Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great
moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task
he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the
faith to walk on water as Jesus did.

You asked ""Why not believe in Zeus?""  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.
You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.

to throw away her academic respectability like this.  It looks to me
like a *major* Career Limiting Move.  There can be very few people
who know what she's been saying who take her seriously any more.

I wonder if she landed such a fat fee from cooperation with the NSA in
the design and propoganda stages that she doesn't care any more?"
